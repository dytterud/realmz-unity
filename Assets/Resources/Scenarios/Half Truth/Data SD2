'You there, the pass is closed, back away.' They cry. 'Why don't you come out here and make us you sons of whores', you respond. That did it. The Runics open the gate and charge.                  üWave after wave of Runic defenders charge forward to pummel you into submission. You awake; bound on horse drawn carts. Runic guards escort you to an imposing looking fortress near a mountainside. You pass the fortress and are carted through some gate.   ñGrim faced guards lift you off the carts and drag you into through a dark tunnel. Salt residue covers the floor and the walls. You are pushed into a large cell and untied. Several guards with spears hold them to your throats as this is done.              åGodolphin is looking very pleased. 'We heard about your defeat of the Dragonriders. Word of such a deed carries through the land with great speed. Envoys from the Runic merchants came to us and have pledged to cease hostilities.'                          Þ'We have agreed to peace. We Karnaks shall keep our land and the Runics shall keep the land beyond the passes. Trade routes have opened once more.

Rowan, the druid, for example seems to be harping on about something. Again, thank you.' Godolphin returns to running his small fiefdom.                 ¶Lord Godolphin greets you warmly. He seems preoccupied with various affairs of running his fiefdom and you take your leave.

We lock the scum of the empire in these pits and forget about them. Enjoy your new home. You won't last the night.'       ±'And don't bother trying to escape. The gates cannot be opened from the inside and a full battalion is barracked in the fortress outside.' The guards depart and you look around.                                                                              úFour huge men approach you. They are pale from lack of sunlight and heavily scarred from constant fighting. 'What have we got here', one says looking at your possession, 'new meat, you're gonna learn from the start who rules these pits.' They attack.     ^There are other prisoners in this large room.

They smell like animals it's difficult for you to stay in the same room as them. One lazily gestures to the corner, 'leave your salt over there.'                   óWhen you do nothing he scrutinizes you. 'Hey, wheres yer salt? I don't recognize your ugly faces - you look like new meat.' He taps the others and states 'looks like we got new meat here boys, time for an initiation.' The other grin viciously.            §As they advance toward you,  you realize now would be a good time for extreme violence as you doubt your 'initiation' would involve sharing tea and crumpets with them.                                                                                        hThey smell even worse in death.

They look pale, underfed and devoid of hope. All eyes turn to the door when you enter. You see fear in their eyes, which lifts as they focus upon you.                   ÚA sickly looking old man approaches you. 'You must be new here, choose a cell and get to work. There's plenty left, nobody lives here too long. As for food - you don't get fed unless you scrape up enough salt blocks.'                                      Æ'Trade the salt for food with the big men in the hallway.

At first you think he might be dead, but an eyelid cracks open and he slowly rises. 'Come to finish me off have you, well you'll see I won't go out without a fight'. He rises to his feet and enters a battle stance.               ÚRealizing this must be Penhaligon, you explain your recent exploits to him. After some food and water from your supplies he seems more steady on his feet. 'Hail and well met, a friend of Godolphin is a friend of mine.'                                     ®'The beating I took at the hands of those brutes who hoard the food was a blessing from Arn in disguise.

One book relates the rather uninteresting history of Tre Mordin: long ago a great warrior of legend, Teague, the founder of the Mordin family, pacified the area and built a settlement.     éOver time, people flocked to the safety of the settlement and a thriving town eventually developed. Tre Mordin means 'Place of Mordin' or 'Farmstead of Mordin' in the old language. The rest of the collection is even less interesting.                      óA book on the history of the Mordin family lies on the shelf. One reference attracts your attention. The first Mordin was a great warrior who was blessed with a suit of armour upon completing some quest apparently set by Arn, the moon goddess.

Servants certainly do not speak in such a manner. The Runics mannerisms change and they behave as if they are seeing you for the first time.                                                                                         ËTheir surprise turns quickly to anticipation as generations of decadence has instilled in these men the inability to back down from a drinking contest, even when duty and common sense suggest otherwise.                                                     üUnfortunately, the 'Riders also possess an incredible tolerance for alcohol. After several hours of trying to get them drunker then yourselves you merely accomplish the opposite result. Inevitably a drunken brawl results with both sides worse for wear.   bThe Dragonriders lie at your feet. Half of the job is done. Now you need to dispatch their mounts.                                                                                                                                                             YThe Dragonriders draw weapons and respond. They seem a bit unsteady but are still deadly.                                                                                                                                                                      ÏYou search the room. Unfortunately, the Dragonriders did not bring anything with them other than their weapons and equipment. Along the walls are hung several valuable works of art, all too massive to move.                                                 óThis chest contains something of note. Among some superbly designed but giant sized arms and armour you discover a sword of exquisite workmanship. Although the weapon could be a short sword by giant standards, it makes a fine two handed blade.            äA group of frost giants and wolves stand guard in this pass. A particularly large giant approaches you. Other frost giants watch the skies. The giant speaks in a deep rumble of a voice 'So you have come to try to finish us off.'                           Ö'At least you have the courage to fight us on the ground. Your friends who cast fire from the sky killed my wife ... killed my child.' The giant starts to shake with rage. The wolves growl, sensing his blood rage.                                          Your response?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ËThe giant considers this. He confers with several of the other giants. Some grumble angrily at what he says but gradually relent. He returns to you: 'an enemy of those that took our homes is our friend.'                                                    ì'If you mean harm to those that cast fire from the sky then you should speak to the Savant beside the lake. There is a cave to the north of here, follow it west to a lake where you should find the Savant's hut.' The giants let you pass.                   EOne giant blows a horn as the wolves circle around you. They attack.

They have heard rumour of your defeat of the Dragonriders and talk excitedly about returning to their tower. One gestures for you to speak to someone to the north and west.                          nThe Runic goes berzerk at this affront to his considerable dignity. 'You have found one', he says and attacks.                                                                                                                                                 ÝA frost giant savant sits alone in the rough hut. He gazes across the frozen lake to the north. He barely turns as you walk into his abode. 'I have been expecting you', he states simply and gazes once more across the ice.                                  è'Beautiful, is it not?' he states pointing to the ice. Shapes appear and twirl as the perpetual northern twilight catchs the wind blasted snow. You sit and stare as recognizable objects flit in and out of snow clouds and ice gloom.                        ø'The ice speaks if you but listen', the ancient giant says. You watch the ice as adventurers clearly recognizable as yourselves storm a great tower. In the mountains above the tower a huge white dragon circles blasting icy frost from its giant maw.       ýThe images fade. The giants turns to you 'the ice has never misled me. This is a strong portent. The very land cries out against these invaders who bring fire and destruction. The dragon you saw lives in a cave further down the lake. Best seek him out.'  ìThe Savant congratulates you on your defeat of the dragon riders, explaining that he saw the image of the battle in the ice. 'It was a good deed that you performed. Our race would have been no more if you had not stepped in. My thanks.'                   USome giant sized abandoned structures stand here. They have been blasted from above.                                                                                                                                                                           ÉYou enter a frozen cave. Silver scales and great claw rents in the tundra clearly indicate that this is the lair of a dragon. You are not surprised when a great scaly head appears out of the blackness.                                                      ÜNine beautiful ice carvings of emerald dragons encased in ice lie atop the lookout platform of the tower. Intricate runes are etched along their scales. The mounts of the dragon riders have been neutralised now as well.                                    ìThe dragon regards you fiercely and then softens up. 'Hello little children, it has been a long time since your parents have allowed you to visit. Why aren't they with you? They didn't allow you to walk the ice by yourselves, did they?'                   !You speak with the Winter dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              9'Thats nice children'.

Ø'Children, it is best not to joke about a dragon being enslaved. No true dragon would allow a human to ride upon its back.' You insist that it is true. 'Wait here and I will take a look'. The mighty dragon flies off.                                       æ... and returns several minutes later. 'I spotted several dragons sleeping atop your tower. They reeked of humans.' The dragons seethes with indignation. You explain that the dragons were used to drive the giants from their homes.                         íThe dragon is infuriated by this. 'Children, wait here, I shall freeze these domesticated vermin in their sleep. Then you can return to riding sleighs down mountains and throwing snowballs.' The dragon flies off again for a longer time.                   îThe dragon returns looking exhausted. 'The deed is done, children. Now run along and play ... and tell your parents to visit me more often. Its lonely now that my brood has grown up and flown away.' The dragon settles in for a deep sleep.                 UThe winter dragon is fast asleep. Ice pellets stream from her nostrils as she snores.                                                                                                                                                                          ºWhat was once the lookout platform on top of the tower is now inhabited by nine large sleeping dragons.

Not only is this not their lair but domesticated dragons do not possess the hoarding instinct. However, without their breeding stock the Dragonriders are effectively finished as a presence in these lands.              xAn ancient ice dragon lives in this cave.

They are drawn from the ranks of the pure strain Runics while the light horse are drawn from the many nations and peoples that have been conquered by the Runic empire.'                                   ú'The heavy horse considered themselves naturally superior as a result.

Four high towers are perched atop the four corners of the high city walls.                                                                   ÷Some scratching in the smooth marble floor attracts your attention. A deep gouge has been made in the stone and another against the short wall surrounding the balcony. Leaning over the edge you see a piece of black metal wedged into an arrow slit.        èYou reach for and pull up the object. It is clearly a grappling hook. The prefect becomes excited 'see, clear evidence of Karnak spies ... wait here, I will summon the Praetor.' As he leaves you examine the grappling hook carefully.                       éIt consists of dull black iron and has simple designs on it with which you are not familiar. The Praetor enters the balcony with the prefect. He examine the hook. 'Why are you convinced this is a Karnak device?' he asks the prefect.                       úThe prefect responds 'who else would perform such a cowardly act my lord.' 'Thats not good enough', replies the Praetor. 'Search the city and uncover what you can about this device. The librarian might be a good place to start.' The Praetor suggests.     íYou ask the librarian to examine the grappling hook. 'Never seen the like' he responds. 'Definitely not Runic. Doesn't look Karnak either, they take great pride in their metalwork and this is clumsy. The kind of thing an orc would make.'                  W'Maybe you should go to the north part of town and ask the orcs?'. The librarian muses.                                                                                                                                                                        vA rough looking orc blacksmith toils here.

The sight of the thing makes him nervous and he stammers he has never seen it before. You suggest to him that he might prefer to make a statement to the prefects. This seems to do the trick.                       ñ'Alright, I don't want those evil cutthroats asking me questions. We Orcs have been the scapegoats for every problem since they conquered us.

The Camaar used to march into battle playing fey battle music which would cause those listening to flee.              þTeague had some Fomorians fashion him a helm which could block out all sound. Equipped with this device Teague managed to successfully defeat the Camaar horde. He then crossed over the southern mountains and was never heard of again. Not much of a story. KUpon the death of the villainous Druid, his novices redouble their attack.

I shall never play that tune again. But let me tell you about Ossian, for I have learnt much.'     å'Ossian lived in the wooded valleys of the Tuatha de Danaan far to the north.

Ó'Ossian's song spell should reverse the time freeze on the Shadowgaunt's lands and cripple the corrupted Danaan watch towers.

The alder trees begin to pull their roots from the earth and lumber ungainly about. Their size is awe inspiring. So is their wrath...       'Proceed with haste to the gallowgaes, younglings, and we shall reduce this Baille to a mossy stump.' The furious Ents march off toward the blighted forest.                                                                                                   øAs you approach the odd forest an Alder rumbles 'So this is all that remains of Llengelly forest. There shall be a reckoning...' With that the ents begin furiously smashing at the dead trees. They roar war cries which not been heard in centuries.         ´But the animated trees are not defenceless. They pull out their twisted roots and soon you find yourselves drawn deep into the sickly forest - engulfed in a battle of living trees.                                                                           æYou are surrounded by shattered wood and fallen branches.

'Perhaps I spoke out of turn, wouldst thou relinquish thine authority over these here foreigners. Or shall I invoke the Code.'

ØYou are escorted under heavy guard to the edge of the forest. 'Avoid these woods if thoust value thine lives, miscreants.' One utters, waving his blade for emphasis. With that, the Centaurs canter off into the trees.                                       ÅCentaurs surround you.

'A scout hast reported most peculiars happenings in the lands of those wretched humans. Thou wilt explain thyselves to mine superior.'                         øYou are passed through an ever increasing chain of command as sentries demand to know the reasons for your presence. They are clearly not a race of trusting individuals. Finally you arrive in the tent of what you assume must be the premier Centaur.       ýAn old but fierce Centaur he is. He addresses you with more restraint than his kin. 'Greetings and well met my small friends. My appellation wouldst be Ironhoofs.

Transporting this strange rock which seems so important to them - but yet which they were unwilling to transport themselves despite their capable fleet.      îNow I suspect why they were loath to be alone on a ship with it. The crew has definitely changed. Mates with whom I have sailed the endless seas now turn against me, and against each other. A wave of paranoia and hatred has overtaken us.                  úI lock my quarters at night and sleep with a blade at hand. I have never felt the need to do this, even in pirate infested waters. I am sure this rock is to blame. I even tried to throw it overboard, but was unable to even touch it without flinching.     îTonight, when most of the crew sleeps, I shall beach the ship along the rough shore to the north. If I survive, I shall head out alone and move as far as I can from both this vile rock and those strange men who could desire such a thing.                  ]May Arn forgive me for whatever part I have played in this evil.

Tain, the current leader of the Scum, has gathered his remaining forces around him, including some large warhounds.                                            He possesses just enough intelligence to realize the threat that you pose.  Mustering up what courage they can, the Scum attempt to engulf you.                                                                                                                µYou search the Scum dwelling for whatever ill-gotten loot they might have collected. Hidden under some half rotten floorboards you find their horde. Not much, times have been tough.                                                                          oSome decomposing bodies have been stuffed into this tight crevice. They have been stripped of their valuables.                                                                                                                                                 õA rough bulwark has been placed at the entrance to this canyon. At your approach a small troll sitting atop it lets out a snarl and several larger trolls appear. They all look down at you. The small troll gestures to you and the trolls advance.           ESome more trolls shamble over to see what all the commotion is about.                                                                                                                                                                                          úYou stand before the gates of a recently constructed outpost. The efficient design and attention to detail indicates it is a Runic fortification. A dismounted Runic cavalryman calls to you politely. 'Sorry, no civilians allowed in the area, citizen'.     =This area is crawling with trolls ... Some crawl towards you.                                                                                                                                                                                                  ÛThe remains of trolls, horses and other hapless creatures have been dumped here. Great score marks along the bones and  charring would indicate the presence of large and possibly fire breathing monsters in this valley.                                     ÁAs if you needed further evidence, the flapping of wings heralds the arrival of some smallish red dragons. You are standing in their food pit so you can hardly blame them for trying to eat you.                                                              ÂA mated pair of full grown red dragons and several other young alight near you. They are less than pleased at seeing you wiping off dragon blood off your weapons. They scream in rage and attack.                                                             úPalthus of the Runic Light Horse stops his inspection of a recently arrived half-century and approachs you. 'Hail my adventurous friends ...  welcome to the eastern front, land of trolls, trolls and more trolls. Will you share a cup of wine with me?'     ñ'Good, for we have much to speak of.' You enter the barracks and share some fine Runic wine. 'Rank has its privileges.' Palthus says, looking pleased with himself. 'High Command must have wanted to silence me, sending me to this death zone.'              ú'But at least they promoted me to Lance Captain and gave me my first brigade. My orders are try to pacify the area. Unfortunately the place is crawling with trolls. We don't even have to root them out. They come to us, they love horseflesh it seems.'     þ'We lost a score of horses before we managed to build a suitable paddock for them. But still the trolls come, boundless in appetite. We even noticed some smaller ones who seemed to be directing them. If they have a command structure I would take it out.' ý'Perhaps these smaller trolls are the key.' He jumps up excitedly. 'Would you capture one of them for me? My men are trained in the lance and trolls don't tend to talk much after being skewered. It is much to ask but I would consider it a great favour.'  }'Of course, it is asking too much. Well, go in friendship and be on the alert for the trolls.' Palthus returns to his duties.                                                                                                                                  KRunic light cavalry tend to their mounts. They nod at you but remain aloof.                                                                                                                                                                                    g'I knew you wouldn't let me down. Bring one of those ugly bastards back here and we'll talk some more.'                                                                                                                                                        ñPalthus meets you. 'Boldly done, you have one. Lets take a look.' He takes the trussed up troll and chains him to a post. He kicks the brute awake and it snarls at him. 'Hmm, I had hoped that I would think of something before you returned. '              'Any ideas', says Palthus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     öThe troll's guttural snarls slowly transform into intelligible speech: 'miserable monkeys in metal mesh. Unhand it. Let it free. Give it horseflesh. Give it sweet horseflesh now. Horse shank roasted over fire. Sweet juices drip down chin. Hmmmm.'         þPalthus kicks it and asks why the trolls are so aggressive. The troll looks stunned that he can understand. It says 'Horses, bring horse to lizards. Lizard full, lizard eat horse, no eat troll. Give troll horseflesh. Sweet, juicy. Now, juicy horseflesh.' ÞPalthus says 'So the trolls seem to be trying to appease some big lizards. They would have to be dragons or something equally terrifying to put that kind of fear into them.' He is interrupted by a loud tumult from outside.                                 ³You race outside to see a large force of trolls at the gates. Cavalrymen are racing to mount up and defend the gates. Palthus efficiently takes charge. You are engulfed in battle.                                                                            íPalthus directs some cavalry units to mop up any remaining trolls in the vicinity, then turns to you 'Vicious bastards aren't they. Did you notice that the little ones don't regenerate? I thought that was typical of all trolls. Strange.'                  î'I think a scouting expedition is in order. We should ...'. He is interrupted by a frantic groom. 'Captain, Guineterax has been taken.' Palthus looks stunned. 'High Command will nail me to a tree for losing their pride breeding stallion.'                 ù'I will lead a force into the heart of the troll lands. I have no choice. We must find the stallion, if it still lives.' Surrounding cavalrymen nod in agreement. Clearly, their mounts are seen more as comrades in arms than simple animals. 'Join us?'      a'I am relieved. Lets mount up and ride.' You leave the garrison and head north through the gates.                                                                                                                                                              öYou are alarmed to see a large company of heavy cavalry charge toward you from the west. 'Stand down, Palthus, you skirmishers are reassigned. Your failures have reached High Command.' The lead rider says haughtily. 'Impossible', replies Palthus.         ÷'Take your men and begone,' Palthus shouts, 'we have no need of your aid.' The rival companies square off, the emnity between the two is manifest. 'I never offered assistance ... we remember your treachery against our brother Slaine.' They charge.        ÏThe heavy cavalry are driven off. Palthus says 'this rivalry which the High Command fosters so carefully will be the death of the Empire.' He shakes his head in frustration. 'Lets continue our journey east.'                                                °You spot some trolls in the distance. They appear to be making their way toward the southwest. They spot you and attack. A small troll in the rear appears to be directing them.                                                                               êYou manage to capture the small troll who was knocked unconcious. You truss him up tightly. Palthus would be most interested in seeing your new 'friend' before it manages to escape its bonds. It would be best to hurry back to see him.                     A large paddock full of horses has been set up here. Grooms and stablehands tend carefully to the horses. It looks like an efficient operation.                                                                                                                ‡After the battle the cavalrymen spread out in long lines to prevent trolls getting past them and reaching the undefended horse paddock.                                                                                                                        ìThe cavalry are now widely dispersed through the plains. You see scattered skirmishes to the west and north. Palthus studies the bulwark in front of you. 'This must be their lair. We'll never manuevre the horses in those tight canyons.'                   ûHe looks at you sheepishly. 'Would you enter these caves and take a look around. We'd be hedged in and slaughtered in there.' Before you can respond Palthus is called off to assist some riders trapped between two large forces of trolls. You are alone.    ^'You found the stallion.' A forward scout calls excitedly. 'Follow me, lets find the Captain.'                                                                                                                                                                 ¡Palthus looks at you with relief. He has gathered the exhausted remnants of his shattered company to him. 'Lets away to the garrison.' He calls and you head off.                                                                                              ¨You look over the bulwark and see light cavalrymen hard at work fending off attacks by ravenous trolls. Perhaps you should find the stallion before they are all killed.                                                                                       ˜A dark cave leads into the mountains.

They huddle around a campfire and call to each other in guttural growls. Some terrified horses are tied up at the back of the cave. One notices you, and they attack with a fury.                                       §Most of the horses are too weak and terrified to move. One fine looking stallion seems to have fared well from its ordeal however.

'We have been through much. The trolls are in disarray. I go now to report to High Command that the area is pacified. Perhaps we shall never see each other again. Take this battle lance to remember me by.' Palthus rides off.   ÉRunic cavalrymen greet you warmly. They mention that Lance Captain Palthus is not here. They do however seem quite talkative and have dropped the familiar Runic attitude of rudeness toward foreigners.                                                       öThey tell you that New Caster is but a small outpost in the Empire which spans a whole continent.

In my youth I wandered the lands and met many strange beasts in the forests and mountains.'           Ú'I even journeyed to the plains of the centaurs to the east, and ventured into the feline infested canyons in the west. I've seen griffons in the snow covered north and even some giant crabs along the southern shores.'                                     ø'One legend I heard talk of along the lonely roads ... was the tale of the Hunter and his mystic horn, which is rumoured to grant power over the beasts of the forest. My desire for that relic is so great that I would even trade my treasure for it.'       ƒArdon looks longingly at the Huntsman's horn. 'I will trade you my greatest, in fact only, possession for that horn.' What say you?                                                                                                                            óArdon accepts the horn reverently and then almost forgetfully hands you an ancient tome. For an instant the images of eleven replicas of Ardon stretch out behind him in a line. The twelve images slowly turn into a blinding light and dissipate.            yArdon the leper sits here on a tree ledge humming tunelessly to himself. He greets you but has little of interest to say.                                                                                                                                      ûAn ancient woman huddles by this river. She is labourously dragging a robe through the river. Over and over again. Blood seeps from the robe and flows down the river. No amount of cleaning by her stops the flow of blood. At your approach she looks up.    ôYou notice a crowd forming around the busy streets. A celebration or some kind of procession seems to be occuring. Nudging into the crowd you see a young boy sitting on a chair held high by some men. The men and the boy look extremely pleased.            ûAs the procession makes its way past you, you overhear some Runic citizens talking. 'The first child of the city to be called to the Runes ... a portentious day to be certain.' Another nods in agreement. The procession passes and the crowd dissipates.    ðA well armed Runic struts toward you in the street. His swagger conceals a liquid grace. A fine sword dances at his hip. He purposely bumps shoulders with you. 'Watch yourself, barbarian, or I'll have you flogged.' He states challengingly.                Take offence?

They snicker as they pass and disappear out of sight.                     ýA lone centaur approachs you. He rushes straight at you but stops and rears into the air before you. 'I'll not have the likes of you soil these lands whilst I draw breath.' He slurs. He is obviously exceptionally drunk. But still deadly. He is upon you.  õA large number of centaurs have come to watch the melee. The clap hands to shoulders in salute of your victory. However, you are informed in no uncertain terms that you must now pay a death duty of 100 gold to the Centaur's widowed mare. Do you?          žWise decision. The Centaurs wander off. The matter is considered closed. One young Centaur takes the gold and heads off to inform the mare of her bereavement.                                                                                                 ùThe Centaurs are shocked by your bad manners.

'How dare you soil her memory with your filthy mouth' he roars attempting to rise. He falls to the floor.              ñYou sit at the table and wait for him to compose himself. He seems to realize he is making a fool of himself and quickly regains his seat to restore whatever dignity remains in him. You take this opportunity to tell him about the Bean Nighe.              þHis eyes widen. 'You're being punished too', he whispers and gingerly shows you his back. Painful infected welts crisscross his back. 'I started to suffer these periodic attacks after my wife died. I thought it was my grief, but there is something more.' ö'She died in childbirth. Thoughts began to fill my head that she had been punished because the child was not mine. I felt it like it was a certainty, though that certainty has faded with time. I refused to bury her with honour, with her kinfolk.'         þ'Now I suspect that I was a fool. What will become of me?' He holds his head in self-pity. 'Where did you put her body?' you ask point blank. Quietly he draws you a map. He stands, a tranquil expression on his face. Without a word he stalks from the inn. The ground is too hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >You unearth a small body, wrapped in a dark bloodstained robe.                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,Bury the woman's remains in the family plot?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   6You feel as though something has been lifted from you.                                                                                                                                                                                                         nThis small island is hallowed ground.

He says,  more than a trace of contempt in his voice. 'Follow me.' He leads you into an inner courtyard. Cells line the perimeter. Perhaps they once held cattle.              ùBut their present use is clear. Townsfolk have been herded into the cells and locked up. A man hangs from a makeshift gallow at the end of the courtyard. When you stare at him the guard says bitterly 'A warning for those that question the new ways.'      øSome heavily armoured men emerge from the far wall and fill the courtyard. The guard stammers 'they're wanting to see your stock.' An armoured man laughs viciously, 'they can join them in servitude to the Master in that case.' They pounce upon you.       éThe Pengelly guard lets out a cry. More of the heavily armed men pour forth from the far wall. But a group of the Thanes men come charging from behind you. The two sides eye each other up. The Thane's men defiantly stand beside you.                       ®The heavily armoured men laugh at the Pengelly guards.

He speaks somberly 'you hold the skull of my youngest child.'                    A skull sits at your feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ì'The vile Boneshavers turned my son's remains into a weapon. A spell weapon called a Tathlum. There is no depth to which they would not sink. They were unable to face me in battle so they slew my son and cast their curses on his skull.'                   ç'While I stood entranced they desecrated the temple and slew my comrades. I watched it all, unable to even close my eyes.' He pauses. 'I am unable to sense any of my kind. Perhaps the Boneshavers tracked them down and killed them.'                        áHe asks you the year. 'So, I stood here helpless for a hundred years while my people were cut down.' He says grimly. 'I have failed in my sacred task. At least I can reverse some of the desecration.' He begins to concentrate.                              þ'I thank you for my deliverance. But there is much that I must do. We shall meet again, it has been foretold. My name is Peredur, formerly the guardian of the temple of Slieve Fuad. But now I have no ties and a score to settle.' With that he gallops out. JAn ancient ruined temple lies here, partly reclaimed by the forest.

Moldly skeletons line the floor. Clearly, they ended their days in violence. A knight stands motionless in the centre of the room. Behind him an altar has been smashed into bits.

Huge shaggy beasts engage mounted knights in agonizing slow detail. Gradually the action of the combatants speeds up and begins to return to normal.                      ÉBefore you have time to ponder this strange activity the battle moves toward you as the beasts press the outnumbered knights towards your position.

A particularly blood stained knight charges up to you.                          ø'I am not familiar with your tabard, but glad of your timely reinforcement.' He says politely. 'I thought I would make my final journey 'ere you arrived. Know that you have the thanks of Diarmuit ua Duibne.' He rides off. The Centaurs look stunned.       ªYou overhear one say that the knight who addressed you perished more than a hundred years ago. The knights rally and charge to the north as more beasts surge towards you.                                                                                     ùThe valley seems full of combatants. You notice more of the knights charging against a defensive position of the beasts to the north. To the west you see Centaurs engaged in a vicious hit and run skirmish with the beasts. Again the battle is joined.      ¬Again more beasts rush to aid their cruel brethren. Is there no end to them! The beasts let out a guttural roar and attack with increased ferocity. You fight on stoically.                                                                                    ÌYou hear a odd sound in the distance. More reinforcements for the beasts no doubt. But then you start to recognize the sound. The calls of Runic battle horns fills the valley, echoing off the rocky sides.                                                   îThe beasts fall back against your onslaught. They split into two groups. One groups heads through a canyon to the northeast, another heads through a canyon to the northwest. You take this opportunity to rest and reflect on your victories.                 êYou see a company of Fir'bolg archers marching to your position. Their leader hails you. 'Well fought, we'll drive the rat-faces out before long.' He smiles weakly. He carries along the lines voicing similar statements to his fellows.                     ÔAs he turns you notice that he holds his stomach tightly. Blood covers his leather vest and tunic. Clearly, he is using his last moments of life to increase morale among his battered troops. He passes from sight.                                           ûYou hear a familar voice amongst the din. 'Hello again', says Rowan the Druid. 'I never doubted that you would have achieved so much. Arn has always smiled on those that make their own luck.' He looks older and more haggard then when last you saw him.    úSuddenly, a wave of evil overwhelms you, thick like an oily cloud. You turn to see its source, a lone man in the distance. He incants an unholy prayer and you feel overwhelmed with the insatiable need for blood. You turn to the nearest victim: Rowan.     å'Hold', shouts Rowan and the feeling lifts you. Around you you see the remnants of the invading force begin to fight savagely amongst themselves. 'Know that that was Clur'Can, one of the greatest disciples to serve the Grey God.'                          ²'I had presumed him dead, but now it seems he was transformed into a lich. Perhaps to continue to serve his master in this land where the living were trapped by Ossian's magic.'                                                                              ó'I had wondered why the Shadowgaunt retreated, for they fear nothing, save their dread master.' He points to a small cairn to the north. 'Venture inside that place of death and destroy the lich Clur'Can before his spell rips this army apart.'             ôYou stand before the eldritch cairn. Behind you a knight gallops you. 'Stay', he shouts. You recognize him as the knight you freed from the Tathlum in the desecrated temple of Slieve Fuad. 'It is I, Peredur. Clur'Can's magic has no hold on me.'           À'It was he who ordered the death of my son. It was he who desecrated my sacred temple for his dark master. I shall have my vengeance.' He says grimly. Best not to argue with him. He joins you.                                                               TYou do not have the luxury of time.

ÒYou return to the surface. Rowan awaits you. 'Clur'can's spell has lifted, that can only mean you were successful. However, the damage has been done.

'You do not yet possess the necessary device to counter the Grey God's protection. Seek it out before you move further against him.

Shadowgaunts hold the position against a valiant assault by the much smaller Fir'bolg.

The Shadowguant stand fortified behind the massive black iron gates. Fir'bolg archers, flanked by Centaur, Danaan riders and even a Unicorn face the walls, waiting. Rowan turns to you.   öRowan speaks 'We seem to have a stalemate. We cannot breach the gates and the normally bloodthirsty Shadowgaunt will not emerge for some reason. They appear to be waiting for something ... or someone. Help is on the way, I ...' He in interrupted.         ÷A tumult arises from the gatehouse. The massive gates open and Shadowgaunt pour out. And their head is a particularly massive 'Gaunt carrying a fearsome looking battle axe. They stop. The huge 'Gaunt roars and points at the empty space before him.        Î'He is challenging our leader to single combat.' Says Rowan. Before anyone can move Diarmuit ua Duibne of the Danaan Riders charges forward to meet the fell beast. All eyes watch the outcome of this battle.                                                 òThe battle is hard fought, with much blood shed on both sides. Diarmuit calls to his war god Nuad to strengthen his arm. Alas, it is vain. The massive beast eventually catchs him with a cleaving blow with the mighty axe. Diarmuit falls dead.              ÈThe 'Gaunts roar with approval. The massive 'Gaunt raises his arms to accept their affirmation. He then points to you and then at the space in front of him. One of you can accept his challenge. Do so?                                                       ZThe 'Gaunts cannot restrain their aggression any longer.

Fir'bolg archers shower the walls with shafts to little effect. You wonder how you could possibly batter these walls down. You turn as familiar resonant voices echo through the canyon behind you.  Â'Ents', cries a Fir'bolg. 'The Ents have come'. Their flagging morale soars. Enormous Alder Ents file past you towards the massive black iron gates. They start hammering with their gnarly fists.                                                             :The gates crash inwards.

Troops start looking to you to follow. Stragglers from the many battles begin to form ranks behind you. Rowan nods approvingly. He whispers to a blackbird on his shoulder. It flies south.     ëYou venture into a twisted forest of mushrooms. The very grass and rocks seem blighted by the aura of evil permeating this valley. A massive castle stands at the head of the valley. A sickly blueish light casts forth from a high tower.                    ÑMarching toward you are formations of Shadowgaunts, a huge 'Gaunt in the lead. You are heavily outnumbered even as the mixed troop at your back is bolstered by a trickle of newcomers of all races and species.                                               þ'They are led by their Jedda, Warskald. Beware his blade. It was dubbed 'Mercy Killing' by his foes for to be captured alive by the likes of him does not bear thinking about.

ÓThe Shadowgaunts are implacable in their attack. They refuse to retreat and are beginning to break the army's morale. Hardly any Centaurs or Danaan riders are left standing. You are again engulfed in the melee.                                             Waves of dimunitive Knockers join the fray, accompanied by their allies of old, the Selkin.

The twisted forest is a scene of carnage. Bodies of the mixed alliance litter the floor. Shadowgaunts lie dead by the hundreds. Rowan moves among the wounded offering what relief he can.          ÖHe comes to you 'well fought. The Shadowgaunts have fled to their ancient cities through the eastern valley. But for you the final battle has yet to come.

There is a boat, and we know that access to the boat is hidden somewhere in 'the Pattern.' You will know it when you see it. But know that it lives.'          ä'The Pattern will rise against you, as will the rest of this plane. Look around you, this is what a world becomes when the Grey God has achieved victory. Not a single soul to harvest nor child's nightmare to collect.' He sighs.                            õ'I doubt we'll meet again. I will have to grow another body. It could take hundreds of years.' He glowers at you, then grins impishly again. 'Unless ...' His eyes widen as he snaps his overlarge mouth shut.

It passes straight through him. He mimics being thrown back and clutches at his chest in a bout of overacting. He laughs, 'Fools, I lost my body, don't you remember? I am just a shade here. Listen.'   ]There is a pull at your mind. An alien presence is trying to penetrate your thought process.
