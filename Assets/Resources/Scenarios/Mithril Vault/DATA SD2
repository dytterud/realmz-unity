ÊAn iron door exists at the bottom of the pool of water.  Hardened tree gum forms a ring around the outside of the door.  Part of the tree gum has been torn.  The watertight seal is broken.  The bubbles are air escaping from below.                         ¡Wrenching on the iron ring, you thrust the door open.  Your gaze immediately falls on a lever as you gain entry.  Perhaps it's a device to operate a pump and drain unit.  Do you pull the lever?                                                              ÊA large drain opens in the floor of the pool and empties the water.  It will be an easy matter to leave this place now that you know what to do.  You hastily enter the tunnel below and push the lever back to its original position.                         ÚYou slosh your way up the steep, sloping tunnel towards the surface.  The cold water steadily washes over your numbing feet.  Finally, you reach the door that leads to the false pool above.  You throw the lever to unseal it.  Ah!  Fresh air!              ÈWith anxious dread, you survey a gory scene.  Fully two dozen shadow elves lay bludgeoned to death near the entrance to the cave.  You inspect their wounds and determine that the murder weapons were a combination of axes and hammers.                      …The bodies have been stripped of any useful equipment.  A few loose strands of chain mail are scattered about.  The shadow elves' attackers felt the mithril in their armor and weapons was worth taking.                                                      ¨The attackers made a good effort to cover their tracks.  However, the Ranger in your party can make out their trail.  Do you wish to follow them and see where it leads you?                                                                                   ‰After several hours of fast tracking, the trail begins to fade.  The party you pursue ascended a solid rock plateau about 60 feet from the cavern floor.  Travel will be treacherous along the edge of this plateau.  Do you ascend?                           kApparently, the retreating shadow elves did not have enough crew to man all the boats.  Some still remain.                                                                                                                                                     πThe dead litter the ground like autumn leaves.  The bodies of approximately 150 shadow elf warriors sprawl across the battlefield.  Twelve of the dead were  slain by shadow elf weapons.                                                                      ôWere they slain by another tribe of elves or their very own troops? Failure in a given mission could notoriously result in death under shadow elf rule.                                                                                                        ºThe great underdark river known as "Hell's Serpent".

You must successfully perform an acrobatic act.  If you slip, 6 to 60 damage is taken during the fall.                                                                                                                                  ˘An acrid smell assaults your nostrils.  Your gaze shifts along the edge of the plateau and eventually falls upon a large walled off cavern.  Drifting fumes provoke an image of fierce, radiant forges intermingled with the strong odor of dwarven mead.      ®Boisterous dwarven song breaks out from several different locations.  An immense, powerful dwarven clan has endeavored to make this section of the underdark their home.                                                                                       ¥Suddenly, from the darkness a deep voice calls out to you in common.

Thoughtfully scratching his tanned cheek,  the young guard searches for  a good explanation.                                                                                       ±"For as long as I can recall, the dwarven clan Huchack has done all the mining for Mithril.  Now for the past several months, they have stopped bringing Mithril ingots to trade.                                                                              ŒTimes do get lean now and then, but they  always discover a new vein and Mithril starts to flow again.  However, it's been nearly seven months now, and we have not seen so much as a stone weight of raw ore.                                                 ·It can't be lack of effort.  The clan Huchacks quartermasters have been buying every  pick, shovel, and necessary supply available.  Caravans even journeyed south to buy additional supplies from the Port Gillan miner's guild.                              ŸThe town council and city magistrate have twice traveled to Silver Peak to speak with King Cormite - the leader of the Huchack clan.  He assured the council that it's just a matter of time before they find a new vein.                                      ƒRumors claim that the town council secretly cast a spell on Cormite to determine whether or not he spoke the truth.  It is widely believed  he was dishonest with the council during their meetings.                                                           ˇSuch a spell can't reveal the truth behind the deceit.  The king refuses to give credence to our suspicions.  We have no thieves guild,  and the council cannot find anyone willing to steal into Silver Peak to discover the truth behind the missing Mithril.ÙThe guard studies your group with a troubled,  yet hopeful stare.  "If it's adventure you seek,  talk with the council.  Every scrap of Mithril in town is in the process of being stolen.  Even the hinges on our front gates have disappeared."              ¯"The blacksmith is forging a new set of iron hinges.  It will take time.  Till then, we must pull double shifts to guard the front gate.  I can't believe any danger would occur.  It's always been peaceful here."  The guard  looks about uncertainly.       ∑As you ponder this information,  your eyes are drawn westward to a tall, ornate building.   Hmm...  the town council, perhaps?  You abruptly bid the guard good day and enter the city.                                                                        ˚You enter a large room.  Rows of wooden bunks climb the walls.  A soldier on the way out collides with you.  Unperturbed,  you question why  the town guard is housed in such crowded, dismal quarters.  Guard: "Ah!  Now our gates hang open all the time.    ˘The council hired extra guards.  No place to billet them in the regular barracks, so they stuffed us in here.  Not too many complaints, though.  I call 'em cozy quarters!"  With a leer of ghastly bad breath and a wicked jab to your side,  he exits.       »A sturdy lock made from Mithril bolts the door shut.  You peer between two warped boards.   Beyond the door,  there appears to be several storage pits.

It's not official, but I can read the runes on the wall.  Captain Ramius used to be an assassin for a mighty northern lord.  Ever since his wife Sara got him some proper churchin,  the man's become a model citizen."       «The council convinced him to spy on the dwarves and discover the truth.  Now it's best that you go before the other men come snooping around.

How did you get in here?"      ˇAn engraved emblem displayed on his chest plate establishes that he's the captain of the guard.  You tell Captain Ramius that you have been commissioned by the council to uncover the secret behind the lack of Mithril.  Ramius: "Your grasp of the situation˘and the fact that the council has been looking for someone to undertake this secret mission is proof enough you speak the truth.  However, it doesn't explain how you obtained a copy of the gate key.  There are only two copies and one is locked away.      ƒHow did you procure the other key?  It was safely stowed in my foot locker under a Mithril lock!"  You reveal that his chest was missing its lock.

I'd like to march to Silver Peak and force them to return what's rightfully mine.  That cost me 50 gold talons!"  Noticing your puzzled expression,  he explains.    ıRamius: "I have determined that all the Mithril disappearing from town has been stolen by the dwarves from Silver Peak.  So many of them travel about town now on the pretense of purchasing supplies,  no one has discovered their true intentions.           ¯The livelihood of our fair city is so heavily dependent on them that no one dares to question them or stand in their way.  For some covert purpose they're collecting every scrap of Mithril in existence.

Obviously, we have both been commissioned by the council to uncover the truth.   Why not work together to insure our success?"         ﬁI have to pick up more supplies and take the time to inhale a decent meal.  Then we can head out.

He rudely kicks his unlocked footlocker as if willful desire will make the lock magically reappear.  He remarks with disgust, "If there's one thing that's worthless,  it's an unlocked footlocker."                ¸Once, somebody stole my jelly donut when I  accidentally left it unlocked!"  You proceed to a tavern and relish a hearty, heavy meal.  Afterwards,  Ramius purchases supplies until his sack bursts with gear.  You return to the pit where you met earlier.   ¥Ramius: "I'm all set.  This tunnel exits just east of town.  I hired a few hungry gnath to dig it.  Dug the entire course in only three days.  Those boys really work up a sweat."                                                                             ˙My returns and departures must remain  secret.  I'd like to prevent the dwarves from discovering we are spying on their activities.  By the way,  I'd appreciate the return of my key."  You apologetically reproduce the key and set off for Silver Peak.     ˙The pit exits into a small clearing east of town.  Farther east is the distant Silver Peak.  The captain whips open his sack and withdraws a small whistle.  "This whistle possesses magical properties.  It was a gift from Rodrigo of the city council."     ∫If dire trouble arises, a single blow will teleport us back to a spot just north of  the town.  Unfortunately,  the magic will only work once.

Ì"I might be weak-minded after a long day's trek and blow it just to save my poor blistered feet additional suffering."

It appears as if nothing happened.  However, you are no longer where you were before.  An unimaginably smooth teleport.  No dizziness.   No nausea.   Rodrigo must be highly skilled.                                    ÙYou travel further east traversing the land as it begins its ascent up Silver Peak.  Eventually,  the ground becomes cooler and  covered in the permanent snow of higher elevations.  A cold stiff wind blows continually chilling you to the bones.           ¿Ramius gasps into the wind, "We're almost there.  Just a little farther.  We need to travel a bit more east.

You whip around to see muscular snow beasts emerge from the powdery,  blowing snow.  Caught off guard,  Ramius splutters,  "What!  How's this?"   ¸Though wounded, it appears that Ramius will  be alright.  "The council was lucky to engage you for this mission.  A more stalwart bunch I have never seen.  If only I had a dozen more like you, I would storm the warrens and solve this problem by force."   —As it stands now, we should strive to keep as low a profile as possible.  Quick!

Slowly tempers cool and good judgment prevails.    √You pursue,  "What is this Geyser?"   "Geyser!  What do you know of the Geyser?  Tell us or  feel the wrath of Morbius!"

"Remain still or face your last breath!"  €Ramius grows uncomfortable at the tense silence.  "Who's Morbius?   Why do you all look so pale?  Is he that powerful?"  You gloomily relate your past exploits in Bywater where you first encountered the twisted Morbius.                                    ˛"Morbius is a litch of great evil, my friend.  We first encountered him trapped in the body of a zombie.  Long ago, in a town called Bywater, a priest raised an army of the dead.  It was a misguided, foolish attempt to battle an evil spider-filled tower. ˛The priest's animation spells caused Morbius to become inadvertently trapped inside a zombie's body.  Later, the priest fell in combat.  His death released the ghastly undead army back to the earth.  Unfortunately, Morbius escaped his fleshy prison, too. ¨Morbius evil is legendary.  He has sworn revenge on us and all who live.

The Geyser appears related to our present mission."                          ıWinterhaven has been peaceful for ages.  The missing Geyser Stone and the appearance of Morbius must be connected to our present troubles.  Be on guard, sooner or later there will be a confrontation."  You search the prisoner and discover a map.          ≠The entrance to the dwarven warren is plotted.  Nearby caves have all been marked "Searched".

If the cold doesn't kill him, some wandering Vusk will.  Come! Let's press on."                   ÙYou begin to pick through their garments in search of information.  As you reach in a pocket, the man's eyes pop open with a moan.  Startled,  you spring back and realize there isn't a mark on him.  The coward had fainted at the fear of battle.           ◊You enter the warrens.  A great wave of hot air strikes you in the face.  The unexpected blast of heat is alarming.  Your first thought is, "Fire!"  Then, "Get out!"  As you turn,  Ramius ceases you in an iron grip.                                        Ô"Hold steady!  We're not in imminent danger.  I believe magic is at work here."  He points to the cave roof.  "Note the steam.  Snow melts steadily from the mountains above.  The intense heat can be alarming.  I'm sorry I didn't warn you.                 ÂMy prior trips to the warrens proved unsuccessful in discovering the source of this infernal heat.  The mystery taunts me still.  As yet,  the answer remains hidden deep within these warrens.  Push on!   We must not remain here."                          They defend the privacy of the warrens with uncommon vigor.

Dwarves swiftly emerge from the shadows.                       ÚThe leader steps forward.  "Hold,  Ramius!  Your repeated attempts to gain access to the warrens has not gone unobserved."  Captain Ramius shakes visibly when he understands that his previous spy attempts were closely watched the entire time.             —"We have not impeded your prying so far,  but our orders are to bring an end to this farce of a spying mission.   Now,  you are  bringing others with you.  Such boldness!  This charade will continue no longer.                                              â"What do you seek?

You arrive at a set of heavy, iron doors.         ˘Godrun: "The king's main audience chamber."  Godrun gives a sharp knock.  The viewport opens, and an elderly dwarf peers through.  He and Godrun whisper briefly in private.  The viewport closes with an emphatic slam, and the door is promptly opened.      ÃGodrun enters.  He continues his conversation with the aged dwarf who then shuffles off.  Godrun: "He shall request an audience with the king.  I must return to my post.

The plates of food have long since decayed into ashes, yet they guzzle it down like a sumptuous Christmas feast of spiced who-onions and roast who-beast.                                              ÆA few of the skeletal figures mill about near the room's entrance.  When you burst in,  they howl and close in to attack.  Their screams of outraged epithets haunt your ears.                                                                                 ˙Upon the deaths of their comrades,  the remaining knights tear themselves away from their phantom meal and attack with zeal.  One knight alone refuses to participate.  He watches the battle as if it were a play put on for his own personal amusement.      ˚The lone knight  floats over to you.   He makes no move to attack.  Weary from battle, you are loathe to instigate another.  There is something unusual about this particular knight.  You gaze into the closed helm and are shocked to see flesh on bones.    ◊The knight suddenly flips his visor up to reveal the flesh and bones beneath the armor.  Volmax: "Ah!  Shall I curse you or thank you?  Those men...   Yes, they were men once, pledged to defend me in days long past.                                        ˘They fell on the field of battle due to my poor judgement.  I was a coward.  I watched them die and never once ventured from the safety of my post.  They cursed me with their dying breaths.  All were slaughtered while attempting to defend my castle.      ˘Ever since, I have been cursed to relive that fateful battle time and time again.  Morbius freed me from this curse.  He once again bent their undead souls to defend me.   I did not know how dear the cost would be to release me from my private hell.      ﬂHe said that I would never again have to witness my men being slaughtered if I but pledged myself to aid him in his cause.

You fervently hope that any potential inhabitants are incapacitated.  Meanwhile,  it's best to avoid contact.   óHowever,  the biggest rewards often go to the ones who are willing to take the biggest risks.  Do you pry open a coffin lid and check out the contents?                                                                                                        œYou start to pry open the lid on one of the coffins.  Immediately,  the lids on all the other coffins open an equal amount.  You quickly slide the lid back in place.

ÏDissatisfied with your findings,  you search every inch of the area.  Several torches have been placed in prominent, high positions near the coffins.  On impulse,  you remove a torch from its ornate holder and toss it inside the coffin.                   ∑Suddenly, the lid lifts from the floor and floats back into place over the coffin.  It slowly comes to rest and seals the torch inside.  Do you wish to repeat this on all the torches?

I do not wish to kill him but would prefer to capture him and place him on trial.                                                                 ˙He had our younger sister killed when she spoke against him.  Though I have no hard proof of such, I know it in my heart.  If you aid me in bringing him to justice I am sure we could come to an agreement that would make us both happy.  Do you agree?"     Malicus: "Very well.  This is my plan.  You shall return to Galarn and claim to have slain me.  Once he hears I am dead he will surely attempt to kill you.  He will not do it right away as it's not in his nature to put himself in harms way.               ‹He will pay you your fee and send you on your way.  Later when you make camp you will more than likely be ambushed.  However, it is my hope to have him in custody by then.  His desire for control of my lands is so strong                                   ˜I dare say he will set off to claim them immediately.  I and a group of my best warriors will wait in ambush.  When he turns south you should do the same and prevent him from escaping.  When the battle turns against him he will surely try to flee.        ⁄When he does you shall be there to capture him and hold him until I can arrive.  If all goes as planned you shall keep whatever reward he has given you plus I will add to it myself.  We should be off and set our trap."                                     ﬁMalicus and his host accompanies you to a small valley to the north.  Malicus: "This is a perfect place for the ambush.  He cannot retreat to the east or west.  That leaves only the north where you will be waiting for him.                                 ›Be warned, his minions are most loyal and will guard him to the death.  I am sure he will retreat quickly once he thinks his life is in danger.  We must take him alive.  It's important that he stand trial for his crimes."                                  ÓYancy: "Well come in out of the cold then.  It pains me to see you warm bloods shivering on such a nice day.  Our master Malicus would most likely like to talk with you.  He does love to her the tales of the small folk from time to time."                 õYou talk further with Yancy and come to realize that Malicus and his people are good and honest folk.  Do you tell him of the treachery planned by Galarn?"                                                                                                    ÙYou are standing at the edge of a huge pit.  Before you are a number of large snakelike creatures.  They are being held captive within a ring of fire.  You could easily traverse the large grate in the floor that acts as a barrier to the snakes.           ìAs you move closer the Ulrick Snakes begin to hiss at you.  The only thing keeping them from attacking is the fire you are now perilously close to.                                                                                                            vYou move to the very edge of the room.

Yancy: "What are you doing!  Get out of there.  Oh! Look what you have done.  How are we supposed to keep those Wooly Beasts fed now!  It's going to cost a fortune to capture more livestock.                                ‰Malicus will surely expect you to pay for this.  I estimate it will cost nearly 300 gems to capture new livestock.

There lies an ancient weapon within a tomb.                      ÏIt's well guarded but I have always felt akin to the place and never wanted to desecrate the tomb where this weapon lies.  However, if you are up to the challenge of defeating the guardians then I'm sure the weapon will serve you well.                     I must now make for home to secure Galarn.  Perhaps someday you could visit us again for I am sure we would have much to talk about.  I bid you farewell and may the blessing of Vishta be upon you all.

You hear something that sounds more fierce that the Aqua Men as well.                                                                            ˝Coming from one of the wells is an Aqua Man of an immense size.  It towers above the other Aqua men.  It lumbers your way, stepping on one of the smaller Aqua men that failed to get out of the way.  The unfortunate Aqua Mans head pops like a ripe grape.  ÔYou have slain all of the Aqua Men and the few Troglodytes left alive are badly wounded and will not survive.  You spot a small tunnel that enter the side of one of the wells.  Do you wish to follow it back to where the Aqua Men came from?                ˙As you prepare to ascend you notice a small flow of water near the ground.  You watch it for a few moments as it begins to grow.  The tunnels are beginning to fill with water.  If you leave you will not be able to return.  Do you still want to leave?     ;You stumble upon a group of Aqua Men working on the tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                    :You spot a group of Aqua Men.

ÂYou enter a large sweltering cavern.  To the north you spot many small pools teeming with Aqua Men.  They are thrashing about as these appear to be spawning pools.  They are in such a state of frenzy that they fail to notice you.                          ˛You enter a large disgusting egg sack.  It pulses with life.  The inside of the mass is covered with large eggs of newly developing Aqua Men.  You nearly vomit at the very sight.  As you fight to control your stomachs you are surprised by a fat Aqua Man. ñIt attempts to speak to you but its language is totally unintelligible.  You try to greet it in as many languages as you can muster but they all fail.                                                                                                         æOnce again it tries to talk to you and still you can't make heads or tails of what it is trying to say.
