The steward announces you to his lordship, Sir Bradwick, who tells this tale.  "Hundreds of years ago a mighty war was waged.  The men allied with the dwarves and elves to repel a foul invasion.                                 √The foe was the greatest assembly of evil folk ever known and was led by the wicked race of giants.  As you know from legend, the goodly races won the day and drove the giants from our fair land.                                                            ≤Alas, nothing good can last forever. The giants have returned to vie once again for domination of our land.  We would drive them back again, but things are not as they once were.                                                                             ŸThe dwarves have become a race of hermits and want nothing to do with the outside world.  They would be just as happy to see the rest of the world fall.  The elves are no better.  They have retreated to Chastity Wood.                                      ˇAttempts to convince the dwarves and elves to aid us have ended in hot-blooded feuds.  Unfortunately, each blames the other for the giants' return.  I believe no one is to blame.  We must set aside these petty accusations in order to fight our common foe.ÔHowever, I am in the minority."  King Bradwick briefly summarizes past and present events before explaining the present tactical position of the human nation.  "During the great wars, the giants beset our land from a set of three citadels.                „These citadels have stood empty for many years.  Fearing evil may still dwell there, no one ever dared to enter.  Now there are signs that the giants have returned and taken up refuge once again within these iron-clad citadels.                            ’Provokingly, the giants have constructed four military outposts along the border of what long ago served as the front battle line.  These foul outposts have been crowded with evil folk bound to obey their bidding.                                          ˆOne such outpost is a scant distance from the town of Crystalmire.  The giants and their evil minions raid these outlying towns and cause general havoc.  At this very moment, they are making preparations and plan to lay siege to these very walls.         ÃAll the dukes and barons of the surrounding lands have been summoned by me to aid us in our struggle.  They may arrive too late.  We cannot count on the dwarves and elves to suddenly come to their senses.                                                   ¿If you help us defeat this scourge that has befallen us, I will reward you handsomely.

"As my liege referred to earlier, the giants have constructed four military outposts from which they send out raiding parties.                                        „Spy reports show that the first outpost houses ogres.  The second contains hob goblins and the third, gnaths.   The fourth outpost houses minotaur.  Mysteriously, we don't know why the minotaurs are presently aiding the giants.                            ÿThe minotaurs may be unwilling participants.  We do not know for certain.  This group as a whole is known as the iron foursome.  In addition to these vast garrisons, they have many goblin parties employed as patrols.

The strong, pungent odor nearly knocks you off your feet.                                                                                                                                                                       0You feel dizzy for a moment, but then it passes.                                                                                                                                                                                                               jYour guts begin to churn, and you feel ready to retch.  Horrified, you suspect the wine has been poisoned.                                                                                                                                                     ÿThe wine spreads along the floor soaking nearby provisions.  You hear a large animal thrashing about.  It soon stops.  Hidden under some crates and sacks, you  discover a giant rat covered in wine.  It is quite dead.                                       ‹After moving some provisions, you inadvertently stumble upon a hole in the wall.  It is just large enough for someone to crawl inside, but they would have very limited movement.  Does someone want to crawl into the hole?                                   €Inside the tunnel, the odor of dung and urine assaults your nose.  Soon the tunnel grows too small to continue.  Numerous giant rats attack, bite and scratch.  As you back out, you find a small gem stuck in some grime.                                     íWith the aid of the wine the flames burn fiercely, you can hear giant rats squeal in pain.   They burn alive until nothing but ash is left behind.                                                                                                             ÿIn this room, a giant uncomfortably sits on a hard bunk waiting impatiently.   When you enter, he jumps up and declares angrily, "Finally! I must be escorted to Jekar at once.  I have been waiting for over an hour. "                                       ˚He immediately senses your confusion and becomes suspicious.  Your inability to answer a few probing questions reveals that you do not know Jekar and that you are an intruder of the outpost.  The giant gives a deafening bellow and rushes out the door.    ˆYou deftly search the giant's belongings, and discover that he was delivering new orders to the gnath garrison commander.  Attacks are to be stepped up on the already beleaguered outlying human villages just before a planned fatal all-out attack.         sYou have entered a cloak room.  Many of the cloaks are shabby and falling apart.  However, two seem very well-made.                                                                                                                                            ÊThis room is very large.  Muddy footprints cross the floor.  Their tracks lead back and forth from this door to another door on the far side of the room.  Miscellaneous pieces of equipment lie about in various states of disrepair.                         ∑This room is strangely ornate, considering that the occupant is a powerful gnath.  The garrison commander is also unusual in size.  He is quite small - only slightly over 6 feet tall.                                                                        ˚Such a short commander must live by his wit as well as his brawn if he expects to remain in charge.  Bursting into his office,  you find him sitting in a high-backed chair with his hands crossed.   It appears as if your visit is not wholly unexpected.    ◊"Welcome!  I heard the commotion outside and have been expecting your arrival for some time now.  You have caused quite a stir around here.  I will have to discipline my commanders for not apprehending you earlier."                                        ∏"No matter.  Having got this far, your presence here warrants discussion."  He gestures to some chairs with his hand.  "Please, sit down."  Do you sit and listen to what he has to say?                                                                       ¯"Very well.  If that is your decision, do not waste any more of my valuable time."  He hurls a glass ball at your feet.   Abruptly, it erupts into tall spurts of green flame.  Smoke chokes your lungs.  Gnaths rush in to aid the garrison commander.        ÚAt the death of the garrison leader, total chaos erupts.  The various commanders fight for total control of the outpost.  Their foolish lust for power causes their own downfall.  The gnaths no longer pose a threat as you collect all treasure.             ‰You feel a growing sense of unease as his voice rambles on endlessly.  Polite mannerisms cannot hide cold, calculating eyes. It suddenly dawns on you that he is stalling for time, when you are interrupted by a knock on the door.                           ªYou quickly deal the commander a lethal blow to the head and throw open the door.  You are surprised by a group of young gnaths.  Upon seeing their dead father, they seek to take revenge.                                                                    €They reluctantly agree and leave.  In a desperate attempt to summon help, the garrison commander makes a break for the door.  You quickly slay him with a blade across the throat.  He slips to the floor in a bloody heap.                                    ÑOn the garrison commander, you find a small pouch of green glass marbles.  They radiate a strange aura and appear magical in nature.                                                                                                                           wYou collect the items worn by the commander.

The room is filled with comfortable looking furniture and several chests.  None of the chests hold anything you would want.                                                                               ñThe garrison commander's sleeping quarters.

As you move it aside, you reveal a small hidden chamber in the stand.  You suspected the garrison commander was capable of casting magic and now you have proof.                                            úAt first glance, this room seems empty.  As you are about to leave you smell a funny odor.  It smells like honey and it is definitely coming from this room.                                                                                                   ‘This room is an old staging area for patrols.  Currently it is empty and does not seem to be used very often.  The door is capable of being bolted shut in times of strife.  You could easily rest here undisturbed.                                           ñThis room appears empty.  You feel a slight breeze even though you have closed the door behind you.

You hear several gnath voices above.  Do you wish to ambush the guards or leave them alone?                                                     As you poke your head into the guard room, you are seen by one of the guards.  He pulls a chain that rings a gong and quickly hacks at the point man.  The force of the blow breaks the ladder you are standing on and you all tumble back down.               @You must move up the ladder single file.

ÁThe guards throw a trap door over the hole and secure themselves inside.  You here them shouting an alarm to some gnaths outside the outpost to be on the lookout for intruders.  This will make moving surreptitiously very difficult.                        ÂThis is a small stable.  There are many horses inside, but you do not see any saddles.  You also have not noticed any gnaths riding horses since you entered the outpost.  You speculate that the horses are being used as livestock.

You barely escape without being seen.  This will make it difficult to move about surreptitiously.  However, it will be a while before the gnaths can replenish their supplies. This will buy the humans precious time.     ‡This room is patrolled by a large group of gnaths.  They attack with uncommon bravado.  You suspect that you are very close to the outpost commander.

Maggot folk have conducted many raids on Brystol.  Most residents have suffered over deaths or mysterious disappearances of close friends and relatives in recent months.     €A towns person speaks, "Brystol Wynn was always such an open place.  We welcomed all, and now it has proven to be our downfall.  There are no longer enough warriors to defend the town, and I plan on moving to the city."                                    ˘Franklin told me that he knows the location of a secret cave. Travel to the southeast village wall, you will find a group of rocks.  The Imhotep Outcropping is a group of rocks just south of this group.  The cave is located on its northeastern side.      ˜Steven Furbough is a foolish one.  He babbles continuously about an ancient sword called the Giant Slayer.  He claims it's our only hope for successfully conquering the giants.

Alas, it is most grim.  The good king cannot spare any troops to help defend the town from these infernal attacks.  He is presently marshaling every troop to his side in preparation for a great battle.          ˘I know little about this.  I am but a simple man in complex times.   I do know that if the king cannot protect his own city, we cannot hope that he will be able to defend us either.  People are packing what few possessions they have and are fleeing.      ﬂThe head elder speaks, "I heard of a great battle between the king's men and a band of vermin at Wispy Falls Way.

My kinfolk are packin' right now and headin' for the city.  Them gnaths to the south are too close for comfort.  I've got my wee ones to think of."   ÂAlmost everyone appears possessed by feelings of frantic fear.  Gnaths have constructed a stronghold just south of the village.  Many of the outlying farms have been raided already.  It won't be much  longer before they attack...                          ÆMost people are hoping to be long gone before the gnaths attack the village.  Although the king's men patrol the walls, they aren't numerous enough to ease the  locals' fear.                                                                                 ¸Bored and dissatisfied, you wander about aimlessly.  The village offers little for entertainment.  Suddenly, there is a massive rumbling to the south.  You see a huge section of the mountain crumble inward.  Gnaths pour from the mountain.  It's a raid!   ÔThe entire town erupts in panic.  You and the small group of king's men guarding the village rush to the area and attempt to throw back the attackers.  A skirmish line forms.  The villagers are given little time to escape with their lives.                ÔGnaths continue to pour out of the mountain passage.  Many initial shock troops have fallen as a result of your superior combat skills.  The gnath ranks are now diluted with younger warriors, but they are still an effective fighting force.                ¯The carnage continues.  The death toll mounts.  You try to catch your breath.  A third squad of gnaths emerges from the mountain and presses the attack.  They have been reduced to young warriors with only a few veterans.  Your side fares no better.       YAn incredible battle!  You send a runner to the king to inform him of your great victory.                                                                                                                                                                      ¸It's now apparent why the gnaths didn't attack earlier.  The creation of this tunnel was an immense undertaking, requiring  months of time and considerable effort.  No longer a secret, it now offers a way of gaining entry into the gnaths' stronghold.     ÓYou turn a corner in the tunnel and are nearly bowled over by another squad of gnaths.  They were attempting to pull a large wagon of lumber towards the village.  The cramped conditions make the ensuing struggle for power an arduous task.                 ’You study the wagon's lumber and tools,   and conclude that the gnaths' plans were  to gain village control, build catapults and siege engines.  You have foiled their intentions and have probably saved many lives.                                          ˙You dive into the water but are unable to find the spring's source.  You swim a considerable distance and finally spot light from above.  You pull yourself up through a hole similar to the one you encountered earlier.  The island also seems familiar.     åYou have accidentally been caught up in the throes of a fierce battle.  A large group of giant ants is attacking a smaller group of beetles.                                                                                                                   ﬂA heavy iron door blocks your path.  The thick door has been crafted out of hammered iron.  From the other side of the door, you can faintly hear gruff voices.  You think they are speaking the dwarven tongue.  Do you knock?                                ·There is a dreadful silence followed by curses of startled alarm.  You hear the loud clash and din of armor as it is hastily retrieved and put on.  A voice on the other side calls to you in a deep booming voice,  "Who ye be?"                              å"We do not know this king of which you speak.  He wields no power here!

ÒThe dwarves on the other side begin to mumble.  Curious, they decide to check if you are still out there.  A small chute above the iron door pops open.  Large rocks rain down.  Painful shouts and enraged threats reveal that you haven't left.              ÚYour foul debasements provoke the  dwarves' wrath.  "Why, we'll send you to an early grave and snap your puny little necks with our bare hands!"  You hear a large metal bar being slid aside.  The heavy door opens with an earsplitting screech.             ìYou stand face-to-face with a group of surly dwarves.  You can try to soothe their feelings or engage in combat.

ËYou come upon a small shack covered with  a unique variety of grass.  A wall of stalagmites surrounds the shack.  Several tracks bestrew the ground around the fence's wall.  You can make out more tracks within the wall's confines.                         óA faint smell of tobacco drifts outward from the hut.  Do you approach the hut silently?

ÎThis is the dwelling of the clan council.  It is a stout building built of granite boulders.  They are fit together with such skill, they do not even require mortar.   You step inside and are greeted by the clan chief and his advisors.                    ÌYou are addressed by the clan chief, Breagor Forgefire. "Split Beard tells me you threatened to beat him, if he didn't let you in.  Haaah!  He could use a good beating!  I would do it myself, but I thought it more fitting to have him...                   ¯guard the east entrance.  One duty every dwarf hates is guard duty.  Split Beard drank a whole keg of my best ale.  I set him to guardin' the east entrance 'cause nothin' has happened there in over four years.  Now, out of the darkness a strange...       ¸lot shows up and expects entrance.  So be it, I say.  This clan has lived in deliberate isolation for over 250 years as we tried to heal from the pain and suffering caused by the horrid giant wars.  We cannot hide  forever.  We must overcome our fears.   ˙Two hill dwarves were here a couple of moons ago.  They informed us that a great war, perhaps deadlier than the first, was about to start.  I promised Lord Oswald and the king that I would help them crush the giants, if they fulfilled my one request.     ÓThey would have to return the Axe of Ashblet to us.  My life's desire has been to find the Axe and pledge my unremitting loyalty to Reorx himself.  However, I am unable to quest for the Axe.  My vow to watch over my clan cannot be broken.                 óLord Oswald has promised that he will make every effort to return the Axe.

The village council crowds around to hear your story of its recovery.        ˜Music and several skins of spiced wine and dwarven ale enliven many hours of joyful feasting.  The chief finally calls an end to the celebration.  He stands in the village center and speaks, "Clan! Clan! Gather round.  We dwarves love our drink...        ◊but our celebration must be a short one.  The time has come.  I must pledge my loyalty to Reorx, and we must all pledge our allegiance to Lord Oswald and his king.

I have gathered together the finest armor...                    ˝ever to be forged within Clan Fireforge.   Please accept it as my gift for a debt that can never be fully repaid."  Pulling off a tarp, he reveals a vast, shining display of superior armor.  "If you like, you may rest here indefinitely.  However, I..."   Ûmust prepare to lead the clan's journey to the surface.  Our kin has not set foot there in a long time.  I greatly fear many will never see this home again.  May Reorx always watch and guide you."  Overcome by emotion, he turns and walks away.            §The chief invites you to stay as long as you like.  Regrettably, his duties shall keep him far too busy to play host.

He believes that you mean him no harm and tells you his story.           ˙I was once a proud and respected member of Clan Forgefire. My family was banished from the clan when we became infected by this cruel disease. The entire family was wiped out. The only exception was my granddaughter. We left her behind with the clan.     ‚My family never wanted to be separated from their kin, but we could not risk the danger of the disease spreading.  We have hidden in this cave for three years.  One by one, I have watched them all die of the withering disease.                             ‡My time is short.  My only regret is that there will be no one left to bury me next to my beloved family.  Alas, if there only was a cure for this foul disease.  The village cleric tried every healing power.  Nothing helped.                               aThe old dwarf is overcome by a coughing fit.

Thank you, my friends.  You do not know what this means to me.  I only wish the cure had come earlier.  I could have saved my family.                ¯His face brightens, "I can still look forward to reuniting with my granddaughter.  For that, you have my eternal thanks.

Red dragons watch as they circle above.                  ˜A mighty red dragon lands and carefully examines the dead body.  After some minutes, the dragon calls to its companions. "The staff is not here!  She has dropped it, as we feared. Take flight! We shall search over the ground from whence she came."        ˛The mighty red leaps a full thirty feet into the air.  A gust of wind hits your face as its powerful wings suddenly flare outward.  Its ascent is rapid. The group banks east and quickly disappears from sight. Do you investigate the green dragon's corpse? ˛You search the area and are unable to find anything of interest. One hundred feet away from the body, you stop to relieve yourself behind a small bush. Buried within, a staff has almost pierced the bush straight through. No wonder the reds didn't see it. ÁThrough some strange psychic connection, the flight of reds return within moments of your discovery.  Determined to reclaim their staff, they immediately pinpoint your exact location and begin to swiftly descend in your direction.                         7The gate to the ice giants' citadel is heavily guarded.

An exuberant crowd gathers round egging the men on. Bets are being placed. The man in fine dress is referred to as Clevis. You discover that the other is named Maxim.      ˚With a major lunge, Maxim gets in a massive blow to the head. Clevis crumples to the ground. His head is gashed open on a razor-edged rock.  Townsfolk rush to Clevis's aid, but it's too late. Clevis is dead.  The highly charged crowd erupts into riot!    ˇCaptain Stillwater and guards arrive to enforce order. The captain sees Clevis lying motionless and rushes to his side. Shocked to find Clevis dead, he angrily jumps up. Narrowly surveying the hushed crowd, he demands them to admit who killed his brother.ﬁCaptain Stillwater's penetrating gaze locks on your presence amid the crowd.  His eyes pierce through you with a blazing intensity. "You there!  Why didn't you put a stop to this?  Your presence here proves my suspicions."                                 ’"Seize them! I will see their bodies swing from the yardarm tonight!"  Confusion and shouting breaks out.

Blood trickles down Maxim's cheek.  He sneers in your face. "You should choose your friends more carefully, outlanders!  You haven't seen the last of me!" He wrests his body from your grip and angrily stalks off.◊Clevis eyes you harshly. "Strangers! You  have no right to interfere!  I shall see that my brother brings an end to your meddling!"  Accompanied by several supporters, Clevis irately sprints off to find his brother.                                        ¯The man in charge of the guard is Clevis.  As soon as you are outside the town's protective walls, the gate is bolted shut.  Clevis gloats gleefully from a high lookout point and shouts, "Do not come back, filthy vermin! We will deny you entrance!"       ÏYou are walking past a building.  A man suddenly leans out one of the windows and motions to you.  "Hail!  I am Stellan, a friend of Maxim's.  We don't forget our friends here."  He tosses you a small pouch and quickly shuts the window.                   The man in charge of the guard is Clevis.  He clasps your hands in a show of friendship.  "Hail, my good friends.  I see that you are setting out for the wilderness.  Wait a moment."  He enters the guardhouse and brings out a small satchel.               ¡You open the satchel. Inside is a jar of foul-smelling goo.  "Take this powerful ointment with you. This salve is useful for healing.  It will aid you in your journey.  Farewell and take care."                                                              ÙThere's a tap on your shoulder. Turning around, you confront Maxim.  He obnoxiously leers in your face. "So, you're still here! Too stupid to leave town, huh? Think you can just push others around? I'm gonna get you for helping Clevis earlier."           ÛMaxim pulls out a small statuette, tosses it to the ground, and speaks an incantation. The statuette transforms into a living mystical creature. Startled, you discover that several of Maxim's lackeys have joined him. Where did they come from?             —"Thank you, stranger.  I shall not forget your kindness. I must seek shelter and rest now.  My foe will be bitter over this defeat, and I must be prepared to meet and outwit any future engagements.  Good day."                                              ºYou storm into the commander's quarters.  He is accompanied by half a dozen of his strongest warriors and a visiting party of ice giants.

Several giant sub-chiefs argue for control of the citadel.  Unity disintegrates.  Bitter skirmishes break out among the forming factions.

ÚWith ebbing strength, a gold dragon wildly defends itself against two red dragons. The dead bodies of several reds already litter the area. The gold has fought brilliantly, but it will not survive this last match unless you intervene. Do you?             êGold dragons are one of the few dragons that seek to spread goodness throughout the Realmz.  You rush to aid the gold in its fight against evil.                                                                                                               ˙The gold dragon is badly wounded but still alive. After a brief rest, it accumulates enough strength to cast a magical healing spell. Rising to its full majestic height, it looks down and speaks in a deep, booming voice. "Thank you, good people. I...     Íwould have perished if not for your bravery. My name is Vestron. Many months ago, I was out one morning when the cruel reds raided my mountain home. They abducted my mate and our young ones. I have been searching for them ever since.                      ıSeveral times I have gotten close to getting my family back.  Every time I was severely beaten down by a horde of reds. It would give me great pleasure to bestow a gift on you for saving my life."  The gold dragon waves a clawed hand in the air.          ¸A chest appears in thin air. The dragon  removes a small cloak from the chest and places it at your feet. "I offer you this valuable cloak. It has been in my family for over five generations. Please accept this fine gift as a token of my appreciation."   ﬂ"Now I must be off. They have transferred my mate and young ones to a new site.  I must save them before it's too late.  If  you help me rescue them, I will reward you with an even finer gift."  Do you join the gold dragon?                                »"Excellent! You are brave and strong and will be a formidable ally. Climb upon my back. We shall fly to the enemies' holding.  Finally, I will be able to avenge the reds' cruel abduction of my family!                                                       ˜"The reds are located within these caverns.  This entry way is seldom used. We'll rest briefly before attacking.  I'll keep watch while you rest first.  When you're ready to venture in, return here. I'll be just inside the cave." The gold departs.        }"Now that we have rested and renewed our strength, we shall fight these cruel reds and teach them to regret their evil ways!"

You quickly remove the heavy iron rod that locks it in place.  A gold dragon is inside. She picks up a pair of eggs and rushes straight at you. You are blocking the doorway.                                             ÂWithout a word, the gold dragon seizes you and all your gear.  You are embraced in clawed hands the size of wagon wheels.  She swiftly races in the direction of the cave entrance. "We must escape before they discover my absence!"                          ƒ"If they find me, I'm as good as dead.  I know too much of their plans.  We must escape and seal the cave behind us."  She soon reaches the entrance to the cave, spins around, and raises her palm.                                                           ¸She utters an incantation. The mountain starts to crumble. Instantly, the cave entrance is plugged with rock."They won't be able to follow for now. While I was being held prisoner, they used strong magical spells on my cell to render my magic useless."   ﬁ"Tell me how you ended up accompanying my husband on this dangerous mission."  She listens in silence of her husband's fate.  She sighs thoughtfully, "Yes. That is just like Vestron.  He would promise the moon to save me."                                 “"A pact made by my husband is one that I shall honor."  In the same manner as her mate, she waves her hand.  A chest appears, and she removes a small golden ring. "Take this. It is our most prized possession...                                             ‚You have rightfully earned it and deserve to be rewarded for your bravery.  Now I must go.  I can't take the chance that a flight of reds will return.  My young must fall to no harm."  She rapidly ascends upward and flies off.                             ˝Just ahead of you, a large group of reds rest languorously.  Vestron whispers, "I can smell my mate beyond these wyrms.  Surprise will serve as our best weapon."  With a deafening roar, Vestron charges the reds.  Magical incantations spew from his lips.  ˘In an intense clash with one of the reds, a claw bores through Vestron's chest and perforates his heart.  Vestron attempts to heal himself with magic, but it is too late. Life begins to drain from his body even as the words of healing pass his lips.      ˛Willingly, Vestron accepts his fate. Death is worth his family's freedom. He begins to choke on his own blood. Quickly, you kneel down and lift his head slightly. He struggles to thank you for all your help. Vestron's eyes take on a glassy, vacant stare. _In the distance, some red dragons lie sunning themselves on the warm rock.

A large bulge near its midsection...       πreveals the digestion of a rather large meal.  Your imagination runs wild.  What could it possibly swallow to create such a fantastic bulge?  Do you wish to tackle this immense reptile?                                                                      ∆Tremendously burdened by its heavy meal, the lethargic worm can barely lift its head.

A fully grown, partially digested fire giant is inside.  You pull a small human-size diary from one of the giant's pockets.  Most of the pages have been exposed to the worm's digestive juices...         Úand have deteriorated.  A few of the inner pages remain and are somewhat legible.  The giant was apparently on a mission to recover the ancient artifact known as "Giant Slayer" - a bane to all giant kin.  The giant's mission was to destroy...             “Giant Slayer by using a magical relic known as "The Anvil of Pain".  While you are studying the diary, you hear the slithering of yet another oncoming worm in the distance.  It would be best to move on quickly.                                             ÿIntent on rejoining the ranks of the surface dwellers, you eagerly withdraw from the overwhelming stench of snake guano.
