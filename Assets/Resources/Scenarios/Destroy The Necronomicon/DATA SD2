You examine its exterior more closely.  You tap and press on the walls.  A rounded indentation, the size of a walnut, almost escapes your notice. ïThe indentation is located about seven feet high.  You can find no other remarkable features on the structure.  Suddenly, you are stricken by an overpowering hunger.  You struggle against a suicidal urge to consume your entire food supply.                äYou place the small stone of gluttony in the indentation.  A small circular opening appears just below the stone and enlarges rapidly.  You retrieve the stone and quickly step inside the pyramid.  The opening immediately closes.                           1A cloak room.

The scents of dried fish, molasses and baked bread intermingle amid barrels, crates, and sacks of various goods.    üA burly guard dutifully watches over several weapons' racks.  You ponder over the offerings.  No handling is allowed without an intent to buy.  The place is well-known for its reliable goods.  Sales are brisk.  Most of the weapons appear fairly common.   žNear the back, a pair of weapons are emitting forth a soft glow.  Detecting the use of magic, the guard growls menacingly. "No spell-casting is allowed here!"                                                                                                 ûWith a sudden jovial smile, the guard slaps you on the back as if you were an old, longtime friend.  You accept a Vlek Liver sandwich and actively participate in an animated discussion over the designs and capabilities of the guard's favorite weapons.    õYou suddenly begin to feel nauseous.  An overpowering stench appears to be spewing forth from the clerk.  Can it be bad personal hygiene?  This horrendous odor cannot possibly come from the clerk alone!  You catch the clerk eyeing you furtively.          ¦He scowls impatiently. "As far as I can tell, it was pleasant enough until you came in.  I've got enough to do around here without stopping to answer dumb questions."                                                                                         üYou jab one of the sacks.  Suddenly, it rips wide open.  An angry, squat dwarf spills out onto the floor.  You stare in surprise, but the clerk's movements distract you.  You turn just as he hastily pulls a sword out from behind a crate and rushes you.   ØDozens of sacks burst into shreds. Dwarves leap out screaming in an unfamiliar tongue.  They're all bald, clean-shaven and covered in demonic-looking tattoos.  You struggle to keep your wits in the midst of chaos.                                          àYour curiosity has foiled one of the Doomsayers' attempts at infiltrating the castle.  Drawn by the commotion, a large contingent of Queen Selene's bodyguards swiftly stifles the uproar.  You are escorted to a secluded area.                               üWith appreciation, you accept a Festoon priest's offer of service.  However, before you can make a request, the priest asks that you first make an offering consisting of an outrageous sum.  So much for the old adage, "Service to God is payment enough."   ëYou enter a stone pyramid.  In the dim light, you stumble over the leftover remains of some pitiable creature.  The skeletal framework appears to be dwarf or gnome.  Peering closer, you notice the tattered remnants of reptilian scales.                    ìYou break open an iron box and find a  stone.  Its heavy weight takes you by surprise.  Its small size was deceiving.  Holding it in your palm, your thumb strokes its smooth surface.  You feel a strong urge to strike down your comrades.                   þ"I can't thank you enough.  We've been watching Porthius for some time.  I'd deliberately reassigned him as storage room clerk.  If he truly proved to be a traitor, I didn't think he could do much harm in this position.  Apparently, I underestimated him. ï"Your help was vital in defusing a   situation that could have quickly  escalated out of control.

A stately man in fine silk robes intently peruses a thick tome.  The queen is not presently using the chapel, and he has time to heal your wounds if you will pledge a generous tithe to the 'Save the whelens fund'.   ¤A stately man dressed in fine robes greets you.

The pungent smells of seasoned, roasting meat drift your way from just around the next corner.  A gruff voice yells at someone to get back to work.                              üThe entrance to a large pantry.  A fat dwarf is whipping several young ogres.  Clothed in smelly, greasy garb, the ogres hastily work to restock the pantry shelves.  A large jar crashes to the ground shattering its contents.  The dwarf screams in rage.   ùLooking near ready to die of stroke, the dwarf suddenly notices you and mistakes you for common kitchen help.  "You dar!" he snarls.  "Help dem varmints wit' da chores!"  Pulling his arm back, he sends his whip snapping wickedly in your direction.        õHe quickly realizes that he's made a grave mistake.  Throwing himself at your feet, he spouts shamelessly.  "Masters!  Me apologize!  Me slow and dimwitted.  Not always thinking what me doing.  Have mercy!  Forgive me stupidity! If ye forgive...          I'll let ye in on a little secret."  Do you  forgive the dwarf in return for his secret?  OR  Do you haul him before the queen?                                                                                                                                ó"Bumpus thanks ye!"  He jumps up and shoves the young ogres out of the room.  "Dey can't be hearing what me about to tell ye.  Ye no be telling anybody else this secret!  It would mean me hide."

Now, I must get back to me work.  Dem lazy ogres!  Me must keep on dem all de time.  Dey get nothing done by demselves."               æYou quickly haul the dwarf before the queen to seek justice for his harsh treatment of the young ogres and yourselves.  Queen Selene speaks, "So, Bumpus!  You still love your whip.  I told you to get rid of that whip or I would...                         âbanish you.  I think you need a good dose of your own medicine.  Guards!  Take Bumpus to one of my private chambers and let him taste 20 lashes.  When you have seen to that, turn him out of the castle.

You'll never find anyone to do dat job good as me!  I did nothing wrong!"  The queen turns to you, "Thank you, my friends.  I never cared for the...       Óheavy-handed methods he used to get work out of the help.  Now, I must ask you to leave, for I have other more pressing duties to attend to."  The queen signals to one of her assistants who sees you to the door.                                            AA shimmering aura of energy fluctuates before you.

You follow an old dirt trail through a beautiful, wooded valley.  There's a sudden break in the woods.  A pyramid stands oddly alone amid an open glade.  One hundred feet or more, its point stretches upward to pierce the blue sky. úThe glade is surrounded by dead yew trees entwined by long strands of bindwart.  You draw closer to the pyramid and touch its surface.  It appears to have been crafted out of an unfamiliar, fine stone.  Cool to the touch, it feels as smooth as glass.     ôThe unblemished surface betrays no visible joints to show how the polished stone sides were fitted together.  At the base, new shoots of grickle grass flourish amid the fresh upturned sod.  Nearby, great boulders have been rent from the ground.           íThe unusual evidence leads you to believe that the pyramid was created quite recently.  Deeply perplexed, you study the base and surrounding boulders.  The pyramid appears to have sprung up right out of the earth.  You must be mistaken!                  óIntrigued, you conduct another thorough examination of the surface walls.  You  happen upon a slight indentation the size of a walnut.

Delicate, cream colored statues of Queen Selene frequent its hallways.  Religious tapestries of exceptional quality cover the walls.  Rich and vibrant in color, the eye-catching depictions are quite detailed.                    €You enter the prayer room.

Descending downwards along its wet, clammy interior, you shrink away from the slime-covered walls.  A reptilian-like odor furthers your uneasiness.  The floor is inscribed with graphic symbols written in blood.       ñYou come upon a haggard, human priest urgently addressing a large group of vrack.  You are suddenly spotted.  Agitation rapidly spreads through the group as your presence becomes known.  The orderly meeting mutates into a threatening attack.              tThe priest's cloak bears a hidden, small pocket cleverly sewn into the lining.

Their razor sharp beaks greedily rip the corpse's acrid, soft flesh to shreds.

Slimy chains and manacles drape its surface.  They drip with bloody gore and exude the fetid stink of recent death.  Four stone pillars are evenly situated around the altar.                         ÷You approach cautiously.  Upon closer inspection, you realize that the stone monument is not some kind of altar used for sacrifice or worship.  It's actually a massive sarcophagus.  The stone is bitterly cold to the touch.

Before you leave me this day...      æI shall give you a map.  It reveals the location of the first coming of doom on an island not very far from here.  You are curious.  What is the coming of doom?  Draw an ear, my friends.  I am about to tell you a frightening tale.                         àIf this tale were made public, the result would be widespread pandemonium.  What makes it so particularly frightening is that the events have not yet occurred.  The tale concerns the future that will eventually come to pass.                               ËIt is a future that will come to pass as surely as the sun shall rise tomorrow. Many eons ago, when the world was still young, there existed great chaos.  Humankind had not yet set foot upon the world.                                                      ÇGood and evil were locked in a struggle that nearly obliterated reality as we know it.  I am sure you have heard of the Abyss.  That hellish region that spawns great evil.  The Abyss has six regions.                                                        ùEach region of the Abyss consists of an entire hideous world and is populated almost entirely by evil beings.  Once our world and the Abyss were one.  Over a period of many years, numerous immense battles were fought between the good and evil races.      ñMany of the gods relished the challenges and strategies of battle.  Others actually enjoyed the continual carnage and suffering.  But time has the power to eventually wear down even the mightiest of gods and weaken the strongest of passions.              íOpposing gods engaged their mighty powers to rip the Realmz and Abyss asunder.  Not everyone supported the resolution.  Thus, parts of each world were left behind in the other.  Much as evil exists in our world, good exists in the Abyss.                  ÈI shudder whenever I think of those goodly beings left behind in the Abyss.  Everywhere they turn, evil must stand in their path.  In almost every respect, the Abyss is an exact opposite of our world.                                                       sFor countless centuries, our world and the Abyss have remained separate.  However, the gods have become restless.                                                                                                                                              åOmens and portents reveal that the gods intend to once again unite the Realmz and  Abyss.  We cannot allow this to happen!  If our world and the Abyss were joined together, the result would be nothing less than a return to chaos.                          ×The suffering would be immeasurable.  Queen Selene has searched out the wisest of sages.  By working together, we hope to prevent this catastrophic event from ever occurring.  We refer to it as "The Coming of Doom".                                        ñI have used my foretelling powers to divine a location.  I believe that this is where the gods will attempt to start stitching the two separate worlds back together.  We must concentrate our efforts there in order to stop the coming of doom.              –There has always been one common point between the two worlds where one could pass from one to the other.  Good and evil come together at this point.                                                                                                          åA book known as the Necronomicon has a dual existence on both worlds.  The Necronomicon serves as the primary connection between them.  On our world it is said that the book is pure evil.  In the Abyss, it radiates pure goodness.                          ÍAlthough I have never seen it, it is said that the Necronomicon on our world has pages made from dwarven skin.  The ink is elven blood, and the binding is made from the shards of bone of many goodly races.                                                  ¤If we can destroy the Necronomicon both in our world and the Abyss, we will be able to break the bond between the two worlds forever and prevent the Coming of Doom.                                                                                           åI'm sure you understand that this mission is fraught with danger.  We have only a vague idea of where the Necronomicon on our world might be and no idea where it might be in the Abyss.  You must search out and destroy both books.                          üOur world is doing it's utmost to prevent the coming of doom.  However, you must be made aware that the evil sluk of the Abyss are striving just as hard to join our worlds together.  They would relish the death and strife that would befall both worlds.   ûEven now they gather their strength to send forth into our world.  They intend to find the Necronomicon on our world and keep it safe.  Their wisest counselors are combining their powers and wisdom in an effort to prevent us from destroying the books.    ãYou must prepare at once.  This map shows the location where evil will make its first attempt to enter our world to obtain possession of the Necronomicon.  You must also go there and attempt to destroy our link with the Abyss.                             ûI fear that we ask too much of you, but we are under tremendous pressure.  Now go!  Destroy the Necronomicon or perish in the attempt!  When you find the book, activate this magical gem.  It will allow me to give you further instructions at that time.

A mass of slime demons squirm and twist about one another.  The tiny room is filled with them.  Incapable of rational thought, they're apparently aware enough of their surroundings to know when and who they should attack.              lYou walk through several connected chambers.  Each one is a repetition of the last - plain and nondescript.                                                                                                                                                    äIt is feeding time for many of the burdened beasts in this bastion.  The excessive salivating is unnerving.   Compared to the maggoty meat served as their normal fare, you could be viewed as a scrumptious, mouth-watering dinner.                           áI have used my arcane arts to determine the location of the second coming of doom.  However, my attempts to gain knowledge of the enemy's activities in the Abyss have been discovered.  Even now they cast magical wards that...                              õwill block out my ability to ascertain their motives.  During one of my forays, I was forced to engage in a duel of the mind against a lord on the Abyss's 4th region.  Although I discovered the second coming's location and proved victorious,...           éthe beast inflicted lasting pain.  I have lost much of my psychic power.  The additional magical wards will probably make it impossible for me to detect future comings of doom.  I can barely muster the strength to send this message."                      ëThoth Amons telepathically transmits the picture of a map pinpointing the location of the second coming of doom.  You hastily whip out a scrap of parchment and  draw a physical representation before the impression has a chance to fade.                    ÞA great quaking unsteadies the Realmz.  It is the second coming of doom.  An immense bastion now stands where one did not stand before.  A great hole opens in the bastion's side belching forth an assortment of evil beasts.                                 íThe beasts proceed to crawl, run, swim, dig and fly throughout the Realmz.  They search for the Necronomicon.  They plan to keep it safe from any who would seek to destroy it.  They especially plan to keep it safe from those such as you.                  <A small group of barrow trolls.  Do you wish to ambush them?                                                                                                                                                                                                   þYou discover a strange stone on the dead viperions' bodies.  Excitedly, you snatch it up for a closer inspection.  It is very similar to the stone you used to gain entrance to the first coming of doom.  It may be a key that will allow you to gain access. [You happen upon a patrol of barrow trolls.   Large reptilian creatures command the patrol.                                                                                                                                                                     ¬You pull out the stone that you rifled from the patrol.  It fits perfectly into a notch on the bastion's surface.  You have now gained access to the bastion's inner bowels.                                                                                   íYou travel east at a good pace towards the dead forest.  In the distance, you spot a large group of creatures.  They appear to be moving in your direction.  As the distance closes in, you identify them as an unfamiliar species of dragon.                  õA stone giant in the area spots them as well.  He shouts a cry of alarm.  Others quickly pick up the cue and shouts of alarm spread throughout the village.  Giants drop their daily work and gather together to defend their homes against invasion.          üThe giants view the oncoming dragons with unease.  Throughout the village's entire oral history, there's no record of dragons ever attacking the city.  Normally, they wouldn't even consider attacking a city of giants.  They would pick an easier target.   æUpon the death of the being, the bastion loses its power to maintain its material existence in the Realmz.  It will soon be pulled back into the hellish Abyss from whence it came.  You should break for the exit to avoid this fate.                         âYou feel a weak fluttering within your mind.  Is it just your overactive imagination or is Thoth Amon trying to communicate?  "Friends, I must congratulate you on your continued success.  You have done better than we  hoped...                             ïHowever, the worst of my fears have come true.  I'm no longer able to determine the location of further comings of doom.  During my last psychic foray, I was discovered and drawn into yet another battle with a noble from the nether planes.                ÞUnfortunately, it was no minor lord this time.  My foe was an archduke, and my difficult victory was earned at a cost that shall be my undoing.  My abilities grow weak and will surely fail before your mission is completed.                                 ðI was able to penetrate the archduke's mind for a few scant seconds just before his untimely demise.  I was unable to ascertain an exact location, but I believe that the third coming of doom should occur somewhere east of the second coming.               ÝI wish I could be more specific.  I fear that the third coming may spell certain doom for Starling, a small village east of you.  I hope you can hear me."  There are a few more weak murmuring, but you can't make them out.                                  ¿You enter the village of Starling.  Most of the huts are rather small in stature.  It is almost entirely populated by furfoots.  However, some dwarves run the smithy and a local jewelry shop.                                                                çA mighty quake heralds the arrival of the third coming of doom.  It rears its ugly head right in the center of the normally sleepy village of Starling.  Terror-stricken villagers run amok screaming amid the turmoil and confusion.                          ÌUnlike the previous two comings of doom, this bastion is composed of three pyramids.  Each pyramid is larger than the next.  You search the outside of all three  and are able to discover only one blemish.                                                   äThe surface of the largest bastion contains three indentations.  They are similar to the indentations you discovered   during your previous encounters.  You place the deadstones of fear, jealousy and anger into the indentations.                           ÈYou gain entrance to the cold, evil bastion.  You now face the third coming of doom.  The evil seems to engulf your body.  You almost feel like you're being swallowed alive.  You must stay in control.                                                       óYou enter a small crevice leading into the mountainside.  Minutes afterwards, the earth begins to tremble.  Dirt and grit streams downward causing you to gag and choke.  You desperately cling to the wall.  Your luck holds.  The rumbling stops.            íThe source of the quake is to your immediate west.  Uncomfortably close, a small, glistening pyramid has thrust its way upward from the deep.  You stand near a small portal in the pyramid's side.  Muffled voices can be heard from within.                  öThe portal slides open at the merest touch.  Stinking bodies in various states of decay strew the floor.  Horrid, dark creatures ravage the carcass of a fresh deer.  One looks up and sees you watching.  Blood and ichor drip from its yellow teeth.         õThe foul stink of this place sends you reeling.  You almost lose your last meal and pass out.  These horrid, smelly creatures must hail from the Abyss.  It's inconceivable that the lords of these infernal regions willingly consort with such ilk.          åYou conjecture that the small pyramid is  a vehicle used to transport trolls to the Realmz.  Although the creatures arrived safely, you have ensured that they will never be able to perform the chaos they were sent here to create.                          ÝYou search the entire pyramid and find nothing of interest, except for a transparent glass ball.  The ball sits upon a fragile stand made of intertwined threads of gold.  A deadstone lies trapped within its circumference.                                  èYou shatter the glass ball against a wall.  You pick up the deadstone and become enraged with jealousy.  Your friends pin you down to prevent you from drawing steel and hacking them to pieces.  You struggle to contain your emotions.                       ßYou approach the mouth of the cave.  A sudden panic grips your heart.  You urgently want to run.  Being hardy adventurers, you cautiously edge closer to the entrance.  Murmuring the old adventurer's proverb comforts you...                                 ð"Where danger leads, treasure follows."     You peer into the cave's murky confines unable to see anything.  Suddenly, a dwarf calls out.  "You there!  I wouldn't go in there.  A full forty dwarves have entered.  Not one has ever returned."               ;You scoff at the dwarf's warning and boldly enter the cave.                                                                                                                                                                                                    õYou venture inward.  A chill wind shoots from the back of the cave communicating icy fear.  You slowly pick your way through the murk.  The fear grows steadily more paralyzing.  It's difficult to continue.  However, you soon discover the source.          þA group of greckle inhabit the cave.  One demands furiously, "Why have you come here?  For many decades we have lived here peacefully.  Few have dared to enter.  We do not want war, but if necessary we'll put an end to these intrusions once and for all!" ùThere's a pause.  You sense that you're being appraised.  The greckle continues, "If you leave now, I will allow you to live.  Otherwise, you can share the same fate as others who intruded foolishly upon my private domain!"    Do you stay and fight?      Ö"Very well, you have freely chosen death."  The Greckle outstretches his hand.  His brilliant gold ring emits a flash of blinding light.  When your eyes clear, you find that you are surrounded by a host of enemies.                                         ¨With one swift stroke, you sever the Greckle's bloated ring finger and pounce upon the severed digit.  Using the dripping blood as a lubricant, you slide the ring free.                                                                                       •A small family of Greckle inhabit this cave.  Skilled in the ways of magic, the Greckle have rigged the cave with traps to deter potential intruders.                                                                                                          üYou encounter some greckle enjoying a sumptuous feast of roasted sluk.  Using one of the vulk's four inch fangs as a toothpick, a satiated greckle lounges contentedly against the wall.  The group seems totally unaware of your presence.  What do you do?   ƒYou launch a surprise attack and charge into the camp.  A deadly first strike cuts down four of the greckle before they can react.                                                                                                                             èThe remaining greckle stand back to back, forming an impenetrable knot.  One flings a small statue to the ground.  It lands near your feet.  The statue grows undergoing a series of rapid contortions.  It becomes a live nether beast.                       The cave seems to extend forever.  Many greckle have made it their home.   A large pride of saber felines accompany the greckle.  Do you attack?                                                                                                               ùThe greckle are totally oblivious to your presence as you stealthily form a ring about them.  On cue, you hit them with a surprise ambush.  The threat of cold steel pressed against their throats makes them more than eager to answer your questions.        úThe Greckle's' tempers flair.  Their faces burn hot red.  "We would rather die in the pits of hell than pledge ourselves to that she bitch!" They almost manage to wrestle free.  You thrust your dagger mercilessly, slaying four of them at close range.     ûOne greckle pulls a small statue from his pocket.  "This is a summoning statue.  When you need help, it can be used to call forth a beast from the nether region.  However, the beast gradually learns to resist its pull.  Use it only when in dire need."    s"We know nothing of these places.  Even if we possessed knowledge concerning secret caves, we wouldn't reveal it...                                                                                                                                            äWe can tell you that during recent time cycles, certain prophesied events have occurred.

We will need it to ensure a successful return.  The great book says that only the strongest will survive the journey.  We wait for a sign.  Then we will know that it is time to go."                        ÖA shimmering pillar of light rises from a great pit and continues upward through a hole in the ceiling.  Your path is completely blocked.  You draw closer to the light.  The life force begins to ebb from your body.                                         õThe light pulses like a beating heart.  You edge closer to the pit, and the pulses' tempo increases.  Your life energy continues to drain from your body.  You stagger back in retreat to stave off this personal assault.  The light's pulse slows.           úInside the ancient pyramid, your footsteps kick up a coat of dust that combines with the musty, stale air.  You cough.  A thin rat scampers off and disappears within a tiny wall crack.  The pyramid consists of a single chamber with a vaulted ceiling.     ¶Voluptuous, green vines grow from small holes in the walls. The vines exude a viscous substance.   Movement catches your eye.  A vine lashes out and wraps itself around a nearby rat.                                                                         ýThe rat writhes frantically.  Its piercing screeches come to an abrupt halt.  The vine has slowly squeezed all life from its body.  The vine slithers back into the hole from which it sprang to devour its catch.  You decide to stay clear of the greenery.  úAn abandoned pile of rags lies on the floor.  Closer inspection reveals that it's a Greckle's rotting corpse.  Apparently, the creature had been one of the vine's ill-fated victims.  You search through the remains and discover some interesting items.     ïYour clever trick blocks the stream of energy.  The beam reflects in upon itself and destroys its source.  You peer down into the pit.  You are unable to see anything  in the darkness.  It appears to be bottomless.  You now pass with ease.                ûIt's harvest time.  Several mush-men toil arduously.  Most of a healthy crop of lichen still cling steadfastly to a rocky expanse.  As plants, they seem blissfully unaware that they are being ruthlessly uprooted.    Do you wish to attack the mush-men?    ˆYou come upon a small group of greckle along with some saber felines.

You study the scene with trepidation.  The attacker was swift, stealthy, and able to take on many opponents at once.  Unused, the greckles' spears remain in their shoulder holsters.    ÞMuddy tracks appear along the edge of this underground watering hole.  So far, you haven't discovered any other evidence of habitation in the cavern.  You study the tracks intently.  They may have been made by red dragons.                                 ßThe flapping of red dragons high overhead  spells doom for those below.  The lead dragon appears to have a humanoid struggling within its mighty grasp.  The dragon is experiencing difficulties flying with such a heavy prey.                                ÿHorrified, you watch as the dragon drops the humanoid to the rocks below.  For a few seconds, the creature's legs and arms flail wildly about.  You're unable to look away from the creature's hopeless attempt to prevent or even lessen the impending impact.§He is dead.  Seconds after the fatal fall,  a flash of light occurs near the body.  More humanoids appear out of nowhere.  They have arrived by means of teleportation.                                                                                        ËFrom the looks of them, it would appear that four are warriors.  The other two look like spell casters.  They obviously plan to take revenge against the dragons.          Do you join with them in battle?                                                    ùWounded and bloody, a titan speaks to you, "Thank you, good people.

Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the right time or place to sit down and explain our story."      ÿYou share the background of your mission and your desires to thwart the coming of doom.  You hope that your candidness will encourage Thyr to reveal more.  Thyr listens thoughtfully furrowing his brow. "Perhaps, I will share a brief account of my history.üWe teleported here in pursuit of these evil dragons.  They captured Randolph, my squire.  He was a true friend and a skilled comrade-in-arms.  Alas, we were unable to prevent his death."  Thyr's face twists in a grimace as he attempts to hide his pain.   ¾"Though we hail from the Abyss, we do not abide the evil ways of those that dwell there.  We would benefit greatly by the joining of the two worlds.

At present, we are using a magical talisman to travel between the Realmz and the Abyss.       ðUnfortunately, it can only teleport six at any one time.  I wish we could help you with your quest, but we must return home.  Rumors have escaped that we are trying to leave the Abyss.  Lately, there has been a series of malicious attacks."               «Thyr's eyes suddenly look unbearably exhausted.  His shoulders slump downward.  The wounded men huddle together while Thyr activates the talisman.

These small, four-footed hoofed creatures originate from the underworld.  They are very similar to the wild cows one finds throughout the Realmz.  You believe they've become dragon snacks.                   àYou come upon an emerald dragon.  It watches you with apathetic, vacant eyes.  The dragon does not move or acknowledge your presence in any way.  Its bones poke pitifully through the skin of its gaunt body.  Do you approach?                               ùYou draw closer to the dragon.  Finally, it speaks in an almost inaudible whisper, "Please, kill me.  I cannot go on like this.  I have been trapped here for centuries."  The cavern walls contain a wealth of small holes.  Rodents scamper in and out.      å"For hundreds of years, I have barely managed to sustain myself on the flesh of these rodents.  Long ago, I was in this area hunting for sport when that pyramid appeared.  Its powerful magic doomed me to this inescapable prison."                          ÿ"Your presence here is mystifying.  Perhaps, I am insane and you are a mirage.  All my attempts to escape have proven futile.  Alone for so many years, I have been forced to reflect on my petty, evil past.  I once relished in the torture of small animals.ýIn my prime, I was a being of immense power.  I wasted most of my time inflicting pain on small defenseless creatures.  It was my greatest joy.  I felt challenged by seeing how much torture I could inflict before a creature escaped me by means of death.  öI beg you to put an end to this colorless existence.  I lack the courage to do it myself.  I have whiled away these centuries barely able to eat enough to sustain this body.  This interminable imprisonment is beyond endurance."    What do you do?         ZA clever trick.

You accept the armor and honor your end of the bargain.                                                                                                 ìYou begin to cast a healing spell.  Alarmed, the dragon protests vehemently.  "No! I begged you to slay me!  Do not heal me!  This folly will be your undoing!"  Too late.  Majestic and powerful once again, the dragon towers above you.                     úSeething with rage, the beast glowers at you.  "Traitors!  You deliberately contradicted my wishes!  I made it clear that this infernal imprisonment is beyond my endurance!  You have no idea what a hell hole this can be for a being of immense power."     ó"I revealed that I once was a beast of great power and savage cruelty.  You will wish you had carried out my desire for death."  The dragon casts a coercive spell.  Cave rats stream from their holes to serve the dragon as allies in its attack.            FYou make a mental note to always honor an emerald dragon's death wish.                                                                                                                                                                                         äYou turn away from the beast.  A long, agonized wail echoes throughout the cavern.  "I begged you to slay me.  Instead, you leave me to endure this interminable isolation.  I will die eventually.  However, you shall succeed me!"                           çA tall, roughly hewn gravestone stands alone.  You clear away overgrown weeds and vines to read a chiseled passage.  "We, the lost ones, hail from a land beyond the stars.  In times forgotten, ABSU  traversed the tranquil Realmz...                        èaccompanied by bright angels.  We witnessed the advent of war between  opposing gods.  We suffered under their vengeful wrath.  Dark angels stormed the Realmz reveling in death and destruction.  We barely survived the reign of ABSU.                       ýAcross the generations, we were plagued.  We scraped out an existence amid the mountains.  The scorpions pledged their allegiance, then betrayed us.  TIAMAT promised to never attack again.  We have no faith in the gods' promises.  They serve themselves.  ñStrife, death, and suffering threaten the Realmz once again.  We will continue to fight for our survival and strive to prevent this everlasting evil.  We know many more will die in the undertaking.  Peace be unto Marduk."     What do you do?              àYou dig.  After half an hour of toil, you strike a plain stone casket.  Heaving heavily, you force the massive lid over until it crashes to one side.  A twelve foot tall humanoid skeleton is revealed.  It possesses six arms.                               úThe arms lie folded across the chest, each hand clutching an obsidian sword.  You begin to pry the swords away from the skeletal figure.  Its jaw drops wide open. You almost jump right out of the grave when it emits a hollow wail.  "Be my champions!"     Wisps of smoke start to rise from the skeleton.  It abruptly collapses to ashes.  All that remains are the six obsidian swords.                                                                                                                                îYou invoke the enchantment of the obsidian sword.  A mist gathers and grows increasingly dense.  Gradually, a nebulous  being arrayed in obsidian armor takes shape.  Small horns crown the being's head.

You've been taken!                ûYou approach a shabby, wooden hut.  The door is chained shut from the outside.  As many as three discernible voices can be heard groaning from within.  With the exception of a small slot cut in the door, thick tar coats all of the hut's open crevices.    íA few dwarven citizens spot you loitering about the hut.  One shouts a warning, "I wouldn't go near there!  Dem folks have de wasting disease.  Even de holy dwarves can't cure dem.  You best keep yer distance."  Do you approach the door?                  ëYou are contemplating whether or not to heed this warning, when a pair of dwarves carrying food trays approach the hut.  They wear lard-soaked sacks over their heads.  The dwarves quickly stuff the trays inside the slot and break away.                    éAs soon as they're far enough, the two dwarves yank the sacks off their heads.

They break down completely at the news of the loss of their family.  The old woman begins to scream and curse at you and your failure.  You hastily withdraw from the poverty-stricken shack.   úBroken utensils.  Bits of leftover debris.  The remains of campfires.  Thousands of marching boots have destroyed the grass and churned up the ground to a muddy muck.  Apparently, a fair number of armed bands have recently traveled through this area.     åNondescript bootprints cover the ground.  However, their depth implies that the owners are of heavy build.

"We would love to sit and chat some more, but we must return to our chores.  Good day."         ÷The farmhouse is empty.  A few cats  prowl about.  You find the farmer, a short furfoot, out tilling his eastern fields.  Two large pigs tug the plow up a slope.  The farmer spots you and calls the pigs to a halt.

ÝThe only time we ever see anybody is when the tinker or the tax enforcer stops by.  You folks don't look like tax enforcers or tinkers.  Hey!

ÖThe gate has been smashed open.  There are no guards in sight, dead or alive.  On a table, a long curl of smoke drifts upward from an abandoned hookah.  Bone dice lie strewn across the dirt floor of the guardhouse.                                         üThis barracks was used to house guards for the gate.  The doorway is held open by two dead bodies crumpled in a heap.  The inside is a huge blood bath of dwarves' mutilated bodies.  Some had their throats cut before they could even leave their bunks.     åChests at the foot of every bunk have been ripped open.  Their contents lie dumped and shredded all over the floor.  There is a steady drip, drip, drip.  Your gaze travels upwards.  At least a dozen dwarves hang from the rafters.                          ÜEvery dwarf has endured disembowelment, vicious mutilation or slashing.  You come to the end of the barracks.  A gaping, jagged hole has been blasted through the stone wall.  Bloody footprints lead away from the opening.                                   §Unlike dwarven prints, these tracks feature claws and are much greater in length.

You edge the door open slowly.  The scene is ghastly.  Forty dwarves have been strangled and mutilated in their own blood.  You come across small puddles of coagulating, alien green blood.     ÓA broken dagger hilt lies near the alien  blood.  The hilt glows, emitting a strong aura of magic.  As you watch, the dagger's aura slowly fades away.  The plain hilt of a once mighty weapon is all that remains.                                            ¦It appears that this rampaging creature cannot be hurt by ordinary weapons.  The chests in the room have all been torn asunder.

Some monstrous creature is milling around outside the barracks.  The heavy footsteps pause.  Do you hide?   OR   Do you rush out and confront the beast?                 You lose experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ÊBegging for coin, a pesky goblin child buzzes about you like an angry Fesp Hornet.  You pay little attention.  After a minute, he boldly darts in amongst you and cuts the purse off of one of your party.                                                     ùThe child bolts toward a group of goblins  that are standing over the dead, bloated carcass of a corelian musk cow.  Before you can stop him, the imp has thrust the purse into one of the goblings palms.  He's probably the leader of this filthy band.      ùThe goblin cracks its lips into a twisted smile of satisfaction.  You approach the leader hoping to get your purse back without having to resort to violence.  Tempers flare.  The goblin insists that the purse is his, and that he's had it for months.      îThe rest of the goblins close in.  With growing excitement, they urge their leader to fight for the purse.  The goblings outright lies have infuriated you.  The heated argument is ready to come to blows when a hush falls over the goblins.                 þThe filthy crowd of goblin onlookers parts aside.  A massive goblin attired in stunning armor eyes you both reprovingly.  He demands, "Who breaks the peace in Shalutie's domain?"  You and the goblin thief state your versions about what has just occurred. ¥Shalutie easily senses the truth behind your words and turns to address your foe. "Bulgwiddle!  We goblins have endured much in our efforts to scratch out a living."                                                                                          í"Your actions deter respectable businesses from ever setting up shop in this part of the city.  We will never raise ourselves to better standards when thugs like you harass and steal from every human, dwarf, and furfoot that comes here."                  ö"By my hand, you will serve as an example to those bent on pursuing such lowly endeavors."  Shalutie orders the purse to be returned.  There is a blinding flash as he draws his shimmering sword.    Bulgwiddle's severed head topples to the ground.         ôThe stunned goblins scatter.  Shalutie's deep voice thunders after them. "Criminals will not be tolerated!  You will learn decency or everyone of you shall suffer a similar fate!"  The last of the crowd flees into the shadows.  Shalutie speaks.           ö"I apologize, good people.  The goblin quarter is full of thieves.  They are a constant source of trouble.  Queen Selene will burn this quarter and drive the goblins out if they do not learn to behave as civilized folk.  Let me introduce myself."         þ"I am Shalutie.  I oversee this quarter of the city.  However, keeping these goblins in line is an ongoing battle, and I've grown weary of it.  You appear to be an honorable group.  Would you consider letting me join your party?"  Do you accept Shalutie? ç"My friends, before we travel too far together, you should know my story.  It may surprise you to know that, in fact, I was once a gnome.  Many years ago, I had been traveling in the underworld.  I was only a young boy at the time.                        ªI had the misfortune of stumbling upon a party of dark elves.  At the time, I was young and foolish enough to charge them.  A mage cast a spell of transformation upon me.                                                                                     ÿI was transformed into a bosk.  There was nothing I could do to stop them.  I felt totally helpless.  They spoke to me in my native tongue.  'This is too good for you.  We shall change you into something even worse!'  As they laughed, I was transformed...ôinto a goblin child.  I almost perished.  A passing party of goblins found me wandering lost and on the verge of starvation.  They took me in and cared for me.  Most goblins are cruel and deserve to be despised.  This tribe was quite different.           µThey cared for me and showed great compassion.  Thus, I grew up among a civilized tribe of goblins.  In all my days, I have never again encountered goblins that behaved as they did.                                                                          þDue to my upbringing, I truly believed that all goblins were capable of being civilized.  I have striven to teach and act as a role model of goblin civility.  I asked to rule the goblin quarter.  Alas, I had hoped to produce change and make a difference. ¼The tribe who took me in was eventually wiped out by a clan of dwarves.  They had no idea that this particular band of goblins could have been the start of a new beginning for goblin kind.                                                                   ÷I would like to continue my search for a tribe of goblins that is capable of being civilized.  When I first came to this city, I had hoped that the goblins would assimilate with other civil races.  I thought they would strive to better themselves.        òI was sadly mistaken.  I've no particular direction in mind.  However, it would be pleasant to have company during my quest.  I hope to be of some service to you during our travels together."  You wish Shalutie success and offer your support.             äA humble shack has been patched together out of twigs and branches.  It leans awkwardly to the right.  You hear the crackling of a strong fire.  The door is flimsy and would not prevent an intruder from entering.   Do you knock?                           øAn old man answers, "Who is it?  I'm very busy and cannot be disturbed!"  He whips the door open without waiting for a response.  "So!  A bunch of vagabonds come to steal my dinner!  Begone, or I shall summon the spirits of the forest to slay you!"       ûYou manage to convince the old hermit that you do not mean him any harm.  He invites you inside for a bowl of gruel.  You decline the mixture and wait patiently for him to finish.  "Perhaps, you are the ones I've been waiting for.  It's been so long."    ò"Before my Zelda passed away, she told me that some day the saviors of Rhulach would come for me.  She never revealed what Rhulach was or why these saviors would want me.  My poor Zelda!  At the end, nothing but nonsense passed from her lips.             ïShe mentioned them so often.  Saviors and Rhulach must have just been feverish imaginings.  In her prime, my Zelda had been renowned for her abilities as a powerful sorceress.  She only dabbled in protective spells.  She made this for me."                âHanging from a chain around his neck, the old man holds up a small crystal entwined in gold.  "She said I should never take it off.  Supposedly, nobody can take it from me by force, and I cannot be harmed as long as I wear it.                             þI don't believe in such things.  My love for Zelda is the real reason why I've never taken it off.  It's been five hundred years since her death.  That's a long time for a lonely mortal to live."  He stares at the bauble.  Do you ask the man to join you? JTorches fill a stone basin.  You sort through them and take the best ones.                                                                                                                                                                                     þThe bodies of dead dwarves blanket the area.  Some of the stone huts are empty. Others contain mutilated bodies strung up by their feet. The dwarves have all had their throats viciously slashed.  A section of the village to the north has been walled off. ùYou surround the massive beast.  It snatches up an unconscious dwarf clothed in fine robes and thrusts a knotted fist into the dwarf's abdomen.  With a crazed howl of fury, the enraged creature rips out the stomach and dashes the body to the ground.      nThe wave of bodies has become a crushing mass of dead flesh.  You brace yourself  for another incoming attack.

Our efforts have incited violent destruction.  We were irresponsible and foolish.  With little forethought, we summoned a beast from the nether reaches to aid us in our evil purposes.             úWe soon discovered that the beast was fixated on total annihilation and was much too powerful for us to control.  Now we must pay for our foolish ways with pain and suffering.  We should have listened to Mastuk.  He begged us to return to the light."     úThe priestess breaks into hysterical sobs. She flees out into the vile darkness before you can stop her.  She must know that with two broken arms, she will not last long in the underworld.  You have witnessed the Doomsayer's cult disastrous downfall.     ÷A massive troll-like creature clutches a frightened dwarf high up in the air.  He painfully twists the dwarf's arms while questioning him ruthlessly.  Unable to give the beast what he wants, the dwarf screams shrilly.  The beast rips his arms off.        çSeveral bloody, dismembered dwarves  already lie at the beast's feet.  The manic creature has murdered them all and still failed to find what he was searching for.  Seething with rage, it heads off to the north at an alarming pace.                        þA colony of giant ants.  A group of young queen ants have just been born.  They are leaving to strike out on their own.  Soon, they will establish brand new, thriving colonies.  To build strength for their journeys, they willingly stop for a bite to eat. òYou soon come across the ants' nest.  One large queen ant busily produces an ongoing flow of eggs.  Scores of worker and warrior ants scurry around her fulfilling their required tasks.  You slay  two guards standing watch at the nest's mouth.             8Do you wish to enter the main nest?

The light beam strikes the ground near the stone structure.  Ice titans pour out of it.

This portal may offer you that opportunity.                  ðYou alone must decide if you're willing to risk utilizing this device.  Unlike our portal, this one appears permanent.  Once inside, a word of command is normally required for activation.  We do not know what command word this portal uses."               òThe world outside the portal begins to sway and blur.  You fight to retain consciousness, while your body is disassembled at the cosmic level.  Days seem to pass by.  In reality, you are suspended in limbo only a few seconds.  Your body is...             Úreassembled.  You have materialized somewhere in the Abyss.  A strong odor of sulfur assaults your nostrils.  Although the room appears the same, you feel stiff and cold.

You lose your footing and wave your arms wildly about.  From below, the deadly glint of sharp spikes catches your eye.  Those that fail to save vs. dexterity fall in and take damage.                         ûThis prestigious chamber appears to be the Hemerood's living quarters.  Someone  gutted the place in a hurry.  Everything lies in disarray.  Drawers hang half open, and various personal items strew the floor.  Your foe must have returned to the Abyss.    ðGalanity is not pleased by this turn of events. "This bodes ill for us.  We may already be too late.  If the Hemerood has returned to the Abyss, it may be next to impossible to track the beast down.  We must find a way to the Abyss at once.               ûI shall attempt to divine our next course of action.  Our clues are few and our need is great."  Galanity separates from the group, closes his eyes, and sinks into a deep trance.  Softly murmuring an ancient tongue, he prays to his deity for guidance.    ùMoments later, Galanity opens his eyes. His facial expression indicates annoyance.  "My deity has answered me in the form of some riddle.  If our beloved Selvion only knew how much I detest riddles!  Perhaps, he does know and relishes my discomfort.      ÓHere lies the riddle:  'Shirak controls the flow.  Once through, there is no return.   Shirak is a singled-minded fool and never planned ahead.'"  Galanity frowns in frustration.  "I have no idea what it means."                                            ñAncient runes are engraved upon the dagger's silver hilt.  You pull the dagger from the rib cage.  In the process, you  dislodge a bone.  It hits the ground with a clatter.  You gaze down and notice a small copper disk embedded in the floor.              ÙThe ancient disk is worn and corroded.  Time's passage has effectively blotted out the central icon.  Obscure writing appears below the faded icon.  Although the writing is still legible, the markings are meaningless.                                      öAs you study the disk, the writing appears to fluctuate and realign itself.  You blink a few times to regain control of your blurred vision.  The disk's writing has transformed.  You can now read the word,  "Shirak".  You puzzle over its meaning.         ÿA provisions' storage room. Intending to partake of food and drink, you pry open a few boxes and feel nauseous.  Nothing has been done in the way of preservation.  The stench of rancid, rotting food hits you full force.

Tendrils of steam drift up from deep within its inner recesses.  You peer into the darkness.  Sweat drips down your face.  You dislodge a stone and listen intently.  There's no sound of it hitting bottom.                   æYou descend quickly.  The wind rushes through your hair.  You tumble down past endless configurations of red rock, cracks,   and dark, gaping fissures.  What creatures vigilantly observe your descent from their dark, secret lairs?                         ÏEighty feet below the surface, a large tunnel shoots off to the side.  You see it well ahead of time and manage to maneuver your way in.

Before it occurred, we were plagued and tormented relentlessly by our enemies.  We are grateful that this is no longer so.  However, we remain discontent.  We long for a way back to the Realmz."               You exit the bastion with little difficulty.  In the Abyss, the deadstones may be considered as an unnecessary defensive measure.                                                                                                                              ³The bastion's entrance has been left unguarded.

Without pausing to think, you simply blurt out the truth.

I bid you good day.  Good luck be with you on your journey."  You wrench your gaze away and try to regain your composure.  What is it?  The scent, the smile, the eyes, the voice...  It's everything altogether.  You should definitely leave.   øYou follow the captain into the citadel.  You see numerous giants as you walk through the hallway and pass by open doorways.  You gasp.  The same five or six faces are being repeated over and over again.  There are hundreds, and they're all female.       ãOpal notices your astonishment and responds to the question uppermost on your minds.  "Yes, we are duplicates.  If you knew our sad story, you would understand why.  Countless ages ago, when the Realmz and the Abyss were one...                            ðour race was numerous.  At the time of the cataclysm, most of our race remained in the Realmz.  Later, our clerics divined that our race in the Realmz had suffered extinction.  Infected by a horrible plague, they were never able to recover.               ¯The small group of us trapped in the Abyss also almost suffered extinction.  We gradually dwindled down in number as we desperately searched for a way to return to the Realmz.                                                                                ´For centuries, we fought to defend ourselves against the evil that populates this foul region.  Two score and seven centuries ago, a great war broke out between two powerful races.                                                                           óAlthough we were not a direct target of either race, we were drawn into the carnage against our will.  Our men were captured by both sides and forced to submit to hard labor or serve on the battlefield.  In the end, only the women were left.              âTo save ourselves, we became trained in the arts of war and magic.  The weaker of the two warring factions foolishly succumbed to our mixture of deadly charm.  We drove them out of this great citadel and took possession of it.                             ÛWith their enemy vanquished, the remaining evil race turned on us.  We defended this citadel for many years while our numbers continued to dwindle dramatically.  Finally, we discovered a method of duplicating ourselves.                                    ³The strongest and wisest were chosen to be duplicated.  We were determined to do whatever we could to preserve our culture.  The duplicator fuses our bodies with a magical energy.                                                                            ôThis energy influx allows us to live many times our normal life span.  Only a total of 2,323 of us can exist at any one time.  I don't know why this is so.  The magic has definite limitations.  If any one of us dies or falls in battle we can...           ðimmediately duplicate another as a replacement.  Over the centuries, our foes have grown weary of fighting and dying.  It confounds them that our strength never seems to waver.  I mustn't detain you.  You should speak with Queen Meleneese."               øYou enter Queen Meleneese's chamber.  She and Opal could be identical twins.  While Opal sports polished armor, the queen is dressed in an elegant, royal blue gown.  The color is a startling complement to her bewitching, sapphire eyes.  "Welcome...       íA messenger informed me of your arrival.  I hope you find our citadel hospitable."  Captain Silverbird informs the queen what she has told you of their history.  The queen responds, "Captain Silverbird has not revealed the entire story."                  ìYou nearly catch up to the beast.  It reaches into a satchel and drops a trio of small objects to the ground.  Within seconds, three small statues swell to an alarming size.  Once they attain their full potential, they become animated.                    lto harvest our mushrooms and live in peace as we search for a way to return to the Realmz."  What do you do?                                                                                                                                                   þThis is remarkable news!  All these years, a means of escape right at our fingertips!  We must invade the bastion and gain control of the portal!"  Lost amid plans and strategies, the queen's eyes stare into the future.  She almost forgets your presence. úShe begins to call out orders.  They will immediately launch a full-scale assault.  You marvel at the Crimson Giants' efficiency.  They have obviously prepared for battle many times before.  "Good folk,  please accept my gratitude for your knowledge.     ËI wish I could bequeath gems as your reward, but there are few to be had.  They are a required component of the magical device we use to duplicate ourselves.   Please accept these magical items, instead.                                                    ŠStay as long as you wish.  We welcome the chance to extend our hospitality."  You thank the queen for her generosity and take your leave.                                                                                                                      û"I thank you for your generous offer.  Please, make yourselves at home.  Feel free to explore the citadel.  We have been unable to use many sections.  They were not built to accommodate our stature.  These areas may prove to be of particular interest.    Í"Opal shall travel with you.  You will show her the location of the portal.  She is skilled in both blade and magic.  In the meantime, we will prepare our attack against the vermin inhabiting the bastion."                                                  ÇYou travel through the cave back to the pit.  The climb up to the bastion takes much longer, and there are some tense moments.

"How does this device function?  Are you transported to the Realmz just by stepping inside?"  Feeling foolish, it dawns on you that you're not sure how to activate it on the Abyss side.            åOpal attempts to hide her anger and disappointment.  "Without the word of activation, it is all but worthless.  Someone in this hellish bastion must know the command.  I dare not return to the queen without this vital knowledge."                          îFeeling responsible, you reluctantly agree to help Opal.  She is determined to discover the word of activation.  You resume your search for the Hemerood with little enthusiasm.  At least, Opal will add considerable strength to your party.                 ùDemonic creatures hang out in this immense, drafty chamber.  At the moment, the cannibalistic creatures feed on the carcass of a lesser demon.  They take flight at your approach and start to swoop down.  One after another attacks with deadly intent.

Superior in strength, the cendook demons slaughter and rip apart their winged demon cousins.  Bent on devouring and destroying, only a scant few notice you amid the commotion.         ÕYour eyes engage in a silent duel with the beast in the far corner.  Twenty-four feet at the shoulder, it's four or five feet taller than any titan.   Do you rush the Hemerood?   OR   Do you exit the room quickly?                                          âThe slain Hemerood's body suddenly  springs back to life.  Before you can recover from the shock, the Hemerood reaches into a concealed pouch and whips out a statue.  It is similar to what was used to summon the frost dragons.                             ÄA large cavern.  In the distance, arguing voices can be heard.  Small snatches of conversation lead you to believe that it may be a group of Doomsayer dwarves.

I truly hate weapons, especially those made of metal.  You are probably wondering why I live here all alone.

I lived peacefully for hundreds of years.  One day a tribe of refugees settled in the woods that I cared for.  These wood elves had been forced to leave their homeland due to a bloody, civil war.              óI have a tendency to dislike elves, especially the egotistical wood elves.  They think that they can communicate with the trees.  However, the trees have no great love for them.  I know, for I talk with the trees regularly.  We are very close.            ûFor many years, the elves lived peacefully within my domain.  One day, tragedy struck.  An untended cooking fire from the elves' village caused the woods to burst into flame.  It had been an extremely dry season.  Nearly half my domain was destroyed.     õI saved what I could by summoning a rainstorm and quenching the fire.  In thoughtless fury, I deliberately and wrongfully used my powers of persuasion and friendship.  I urged the burnt, mangled trees to retaliate and destroy the elves' village.          üWhen I calmed down, I was horrified by what I had done.  I banished myself to this lonely, evil island.  I couldn't risk losing control and inflicting such devastating harm ever again.  Some of the trees that helped destroy the elves live here with me.   ÿThey also struggle with the guilt of their hasty, violent retaliation. Living on this miserable island for nearly two hundred years has forced me to become familiar with its evil inhabitants.  A clan of evil dwarves lies just east of here.  To the west...ûlive horrid mutants.  They're half spider and half elf.  I would destroy them all, especially the perverted elf creatures.  However, my guilt keeps me in check.  I strive to live a lonely life of peace.  I bother no one, and no one dares to bother me.    øYou are good folk.  It would please me if you would accept these gifts.  I created them many years ago.  It was my small effort to heal the elves that had survived my rage.  Unfortunately, the few survivors were very bitter.  Most refused my help.        ùIn your possession, they may be put to good use.  If you eventually intend to return to the surface world, I would like to come with you.  I have endured this  malevolent place long enough.  I wish to return home."  Do you accept her into the group?      ÿShe smiles. "Allow me a few moments to bid farewell to my friends."  The dryad walks outside and converses with the large, burnt trees.  Their branches tremble and bend down in sorrow.  One might think they were actually weeping.  Eventually, she returns.°Before the powerful summoning magic has a chance to be invoked, you strike a deadly blow.  The inanimate statue crashes to the floor.

The flapping of hundreds of tiny wings from above halts your progress.  You gaze upward.  A swarm of winged demons fly overhead.  They head directly towards the giants.          õThe small demons descend upon the giants.  The giants seize and bash them to the ground.  You quickly lose sight of the large brutes as they become enveloped in an immense cloud of small, flapping bodies.  Some larger demons arrive on the scene.          ïThe larger demons direct the smaller demons' attack.  Their losses are numerous.  Small bodies blanket the ground.  The giants gradually yield to defeat due to the opposing force's sheer size.  The demons descend to rest their weary wings.                qDo you wait patiently to see if they will leave?

Come visit our city so we may thank you properly."                        ùYou travel southeast.  Finally, you arrive at the iron gates to a massive, heavily populated city.  It bustles with giants representing a wide variety of trades.  Armed soldiers patrol the walls.  Razor sharp wires have been strung along tall poles.      ÕThe wires probably defend against air assaults conducted by the giants' winged enemies.  Many small towers about the city hold loaded ballista.  They are ready to repel any enemy lucky enough to survive the wires.                                          ÿYour new friend points out various places  of interest as you make your way to the palace.

Teltnuag mentioned that these accursed winged demons actually hail from the southwest of here.  The area is a stinking breeding pit.            ÖYou head west and shortly arrive in the winged demons' territory.  Teltnuag's description was fairly accurate.  Smoking pits have been built near many of the caverns.  The remains of dead bodies cover the ground.                                           ûMost of the remains are demon.  There are hundreds of them.  Other bones representing nether world beings of various demonic descent lie scattered here and there.  You examine some of the bodies.  Clearly, they did not die in combat.  They were eaten.    ©In the middle of the cave, two winged demons slowly turn a huge spit over a glowing bed of coals.  The well-done, roasting carcass is one of their winged demon brothers.                                                                                      üBarbaric cannibalism!  The Abyss knows no bounds when it comes to fear, distrust, and ruthlessness.  Atop a throne carved from a stalagmite, a large beast sits surrounded by others of its kind.  The rest are much shorter, averaging about ten feet high.   äWisps of smoke trail from its flared nostrils as the beast leans forward.

I foresee a delicious feast of tender delicacies!"                           õThe demons are allowed only a brief rest before their masters herd them southeast.

I am already aware of the events which you attempt to prevent.  Not too long ago, I battled with a wizard from the Realmz and deliberately broke off the mental engagement.  I wanted the weak-minded human to believe that he had won.    ËThe fool!  He had a puny mind!  I could have squashed it like a bug.  Instead, I let the fool believe he had won.  During his feeble attempt at battle, I probed his mind and learned all about your plans.                                                    ùFrankly, I didn't expect you to live long enough to make it this far.  However, it's thoughtful of you to come here directly.  When torturing you finally turns out to be more boredom than pleasure, I'll suck the marrow from your sweet, tender bones.      In a flash, the beast leaps for the cave's ceiling.  A sudden outburst of lavender flames envelop you.  Suddenly you feel dazed and confused.                                                                                                                  7The beast calls forth his demon minions.

Your difficult behavior demands immediate, painful death."       ÔBolting for a large iron door set deep within the cavern wall, the beast pulls a heavy iron pin out of its latch.  The door explodes open.  You stare into the grinning face of a Hells Assassin.

You wrestle with possible methods of obtaining the stone from the misty, swirling vault.                                                                                ¢The door bears a stone plaque etched with the following inscription: "Enter not, lest ye be devoid of life.

Your attention is drawn to the floor.  Small, colored tiles have been used to create a panoramic mosaic.  The mosaic begins to shift and change before your eyes.  Flashing from scene to scene, it reenacts a battle from eons past.       ÃThe battle depicts two opposing armies.  An army of undead vs. an army of light.  The army of light consists of dwarves and ogres who have banded together.  Their army numbers in the thousands.                                                              ÈTwo skeletal figures lead the army of the undead.  Each skeletal figure holds a raised deadstone.  Rays of light shoot from the deadstones.  The rays pierce the hearts of every dwarf and ogre soldier.                                                       The rays of light suck the life force from its victims.  The carnage mounts.  The living succumb helplessly under the merciless onslaught of the undead army.                                                                                                  äThe undead almost completely crush the army of light.  Suddenly, the battle takes a unique turn.  Dwarven clerics cast magic spells to re animate their fallen comrades.  The army of light now includes numerous undead soldiers.                             ±The rays of death from the deadstones pass through the re animated dwarven and ogre soldiers with no effect.  The undead ogres and dwarves begin to drive back the undead army.                                                                                ýThe long, bloody battle finally ends with victory for the army of light.  The mosaic restarts and portrays the arduous battle in its entirety, scene by scene.  You're intrigued that the powerful deadstones have no effect on beings that are already dead.  üA small boy dressed in a dirty leather jerkin hails you.  Tightly grasping a scroll in one unwashed hand, he hands it to you and darts off.  You open it and read, "You are hereby summoned to stand before Queen Selene."  It includes a map to the castle.   îYou prepare to exit the narrow, rocky crag.  A giant patrol comes up behind you.  One of the giants kneels by a fallen comrade and weeps.  Sensing that the giants aren't evil, you waver indecisively.  You approach the patrol with caution.                 ×Two giants block your approach towards the grieving giant.  They make no move to harm you.  After a brief period of mourning, the giant stands.  He speaks privately to one of his men and gestures towards your party.                                        ‚I find your foul mouths to be loathsome and offensive!  I have better things to do than speak or associate with such lowbrow scum!                                                                                                                             ÒThe image fades as the hand withdraws the stone from the vortex.  The hand  distinctly lacks the healthy coloring and flexibility that one associates with the living.  It could be the animated hand of a zombie.                                             \A Doomsayer patrol discovers you.  A monstrous Gorgons with a snake-like body is in command.                                                                                                                                                                   ÏDead, dismembered bodies of frost giants and snow yeti lie scattered about the stone pyramid.  Some of the bodies materialized partly inside the pyramid walls.  Limbs, torsos, and heads jut out of the stone.                                                ìThe journey to the Realmz proved to be a disastrous one for these vermin.  One arm, in particular, begs your attention as it juts from the pyramid's side.  Unlike a giant's arm, it is covered in green scales and flaunts blood red nails.                   ®You recognize it as the arm of a demon.  Its body materialized inside the solid stone of the pyramid.  Just below the lifeless hand, a deadstone lies abandoned on the ground.                                                                                 à"Fools!  I possess eternal life and cannot be destroyed.  It is simply a matter of time before I find a body that will carry my spirit back into the Realmz.  When that time comes, you will no longer be able to hide from me."                               ÃFrost giants and snow yeti are deep in the throes of an intense, passionate debate.  The domineering giants continually point westward as they try to bully the yeti into carrying out some task.                                                              »Someone spots your group and gives a shout.

It must have been cut from the litch's hand during battle.  The scrawny digit bears a ring fashioned from a deadstone.                                                                              `Rothians guard the gate.

A bundle of spears is set just out of reach.                             øUlcerous wounds mark their bodies.  One of the creatures begs you to help them.  "Please, free us!  We were captured and imprisoned here long ago.  The foul beasts have been torturing and feeding on us.  If you leave us here, we are doomed to die."       ÎYour conversation with the creatures assures you that they are not evil in nature.  After you set them free, they quickly take up their spears.  "There's no time to lose.

Bloody tiger paws and limbs dangle from wall chains.  The smell of tortured death permeates the air.  Apparently, tigers were chained to these walls, and their limbs and bodies were ripped asunder.          öThe tigtaurs' leader experiences excruciating pain from a broken back.  She motions for you to approach.  "Friends, the thought of never seeing my home again saddens me greatly.  At least, I'll no longer be forced to submit to grueling torture...         ßPlease, take my spear.  It is a noble weapon.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to die with dignity.  I am content to have died in battle with weapon in paw."  She closes her eyes and heaves a trembling, last breath.                                NSeveral paw prints have left impressions in the ground near the southern wall.                                                                                                                                                                                 bA rush of wind sails up from below.

Do you attack?                ýDetermined to force your way in, you draw your weapons.  The tigtaurs' head guard hails you in a commanding voice, "Stand fast!  Due to your earnestness, I will grant your request for entry, but be warned.  We will brook no violence against our people."  ûYou head towards a lone building.  A small graveyard can be seen in the distance.  Much of the available land is taken up by a vast orchard.  Huge evergreens tower over fields of mushrooms.  Over the orchard, a luminous orb glows as bright as the sun.    ¡The orb's magic sustains the evergreens.  Tigtaurs are steadily at work harvesting mushrooms.  Other tigtaurs collect seed cones that have fallen from the trees.

For eons, we have struggled to survive.  Evil races have periodically forced us to move.  Several times they took possession of our land.  Now, we defend and cultivate a small area.  It's a bare fraction of our previous holdings.             ÎWe have managed to retain only a few remnants of our past.  The few trees  outside are all that is left.

To commit evil is against our nature.íTwo of my bravest warriors shall travel with you.  They are skilled in the arts of warfare and will serve you well."  Evelyn summons the two to her side.  The first warrior is large and powerful.  The second appears to be a spell caster.                   "It would be dishonest for me to wish you success in your mission.  Deep down, I pray for your failure.  Please, go.

A rider upon the back of a huge dragon captures your attention.  Precious seconds pass before you fully recognize the figure atop the winged beast.                             ÎIt is Morbius.  You lock gazes with the damnable Demi litch.  A bloodcurdling screech expels from his bony jaws.  "Fools!  We meet yet again.  Only now it is I, Morbius, who comes calling upon the sleeping.                                                 rPrepare to die, foul mortals!  In death, my power over you shall rise tenfold.

ÙWith a thunderous blast, lightning strikes the wing of Morbius's mount.  The dragon shrieks piercingly as its wing shatters apart.  Bone fragments and blood fleck the sky.  Morbius and his mount plummet to the ground.                                      ËThe dragon's body is savagely crushed on impact.  A grisly figure covered in blood and ichor emerges from the gory remains.  Morbius stalks in your direction.  He has survived the fall without a scratch.                                                    òThe shock of Morbius's bloodstained figure emerging from the dragon's crushed carcass leaves you stunned.  Morbius aims a bony finger directly at Queen Selene.  Although you're not close enough to hear, you sense that he speaks words of doom.             ·A young acolyte dives before the queen to bear the full brunt of Morbius's death spell.  The life force quickly drains from his body.  Pale and bloodless, he crumples to the ground.                                                                          øBefore you can engage Morbius, he rapidly chants a second spell.  Queen Selene looks at you with a last, imploring gaze as the life force is ruthlessly wrenched from her body.  She collapses upon the young acolyte.  Her sightless eyes stare upward.       õConsumed by primal rage, you race towards Morbius.  You will exterminate this depraved creature, once and for all.  Seconds later, your advance is thwarted by a battle line of fire drakes.  Shaking with fury, you curse a vicious stream of oaths.          ßAfter successfully slaying the drakes, you search the chaos for Morbius himself.  Smaller battles rage about you.  The city writhes in flames.  Temple clerics use their holy magic to struggle valiantly against the drakes.                                  ÿShell-shocked over Queen Selene's sudden death, Thoth Amon joins you.  Love for the queen lines his face. Looking haggard and ill, he struggles to focus on the matter at hand.  Two proteges accompany him.  Together, you'll fight the mother of all battles.ËYou descend upon Morbius.  Drakes press in on your flanks.  You must shift to a defensive position in order to fend off the infernal foes.  Morbius takes advantage of the entanglement and casts a spell.                                                     íThe litch clones himself.  There are now four in all.  Only one is the true Morbius, and it is he that must be destroyed.  Unfortunately, each litch possesses all the deadly powers of the original, and you have no idea which one is real.                  ÊYour peripheral vision perceives a door closing in the far corner.  You dart your gaze in that direction and scrutinize the area suspiciously.  Was it just your imagination?  It looks like a solid wall.                                                     ÔYou stand upon the remains of Morbius's skeletal body and zestfully grind it to dust.  A sibilant voice creeps in your ear,  "Mortals, you may destroy this material shell.  It matters not.  This hasn't ended yet.                                           ±I have pursued you from the depths of the Abyss.  My spirit may be imprisoned or cast into another state of existence.

He is badly wounded.  You desperately scan the area for help.  Few clerics lived through the battle.  Most  have been drained of power.  You offer Thoth a healing potion.  He refuses it.            Ù"I have no wish to be healed.  I shall join  Selene in death.  Her duties as queen kept us apart, but in the nether world no such restrictions exist.  I have lived a long and full life.  The choice is mine to end it."                                      ÓThoth Amon's head awkwardly lolls against the bloodstained grass.  Several prominent townsfolk roughly push you aside to tend to his body.  "You brought this upon us!

The grieving crowd tightly closes in around Selene.  Anger ripples through the multitude.  An old man in fine robes cries, "Begone!  I swear, by the gods, I'll kill you myself!" ñAs a traveler, you have witnessed your share of riots.  With growing alarm, you sense dangerous emotions.  Electrifying tension flows through the crowd and intensifies.  Fearful of the citizens' wrath, you head straight for the city's gates.              ûA woman frustrates your attempt to exit the city quickly.  "Forgive them.  The people are angry and upset.  They want to take out their hurt on someone.  The man in the silk robes who denounced you is Remdigis, the eldest member of the ruling council.    ÿHe truly doesn't believe you're responsible for the queen's death any more than I do.  You are simply the pawn in a political power struggle.  With the queen's death, feuding is inevitable.  Many will seek to gain control. The victor shall rule this land.ýAs the eldest member of the ruling council, Remdigis has strong support.  He will likely rule.  When the queen announced you as new members of the council, he felt threatened.  He's deliberately turned the masses against you to force you out of the way.  ýI'm sorry that his ploy succeeded."  You leave the city and search for a safe place to rest.  That night you toss and turn restlessly.  Over and over, you relive the tragic deaths of Selene and Thoth and feel betrayed when the citizens turn against you.  øYou sit up anxiously and stare into the fire.  The warmth is comforting.  A true hero does not seek fame or glory.  Although it hurts deeply that the citizens turned their backs on you, you know in your heart that you worked hard and achieved much.       ÷You sit quietly about the campfire halfheartedly gnawing on tasteless leftovers.  The small glade, deep within the forest, is oddly quiet.  Suddenly, the fire's flames leap skyward.  The images of Queen Selene and Thoth Amon shimmer in the flames.        ÄThe diaphanous figures embrace one another as lovers.  The queen's translucent image speaks, "My friends, do not grieve over our passing.  In the midst of death, we have discovered true happiness.                                                           ôWe have longed for the day when we could be together.  The peoples' reaction is based on sad ignorance.  Perhaps, it's for the best.  As great adventurers, you would grow weary of sitting council and tending to the day-to-day needs of a nation.           þWestmore must be rebuilt to its former stature. It will require work and planning.  You would weary of this task. A need for adventure precludes your staying and settling down.  We wish you the best but can offer you little in the form of material goods. ÿHowever, we can give you something to help you survive your travels." The two figures enfold you in a wispy embrace.  After a slight nautious sensation, a surge of energy jolts through your bodies.  You're sharply aware of an influx of amazing new powers.ôThe two figures smile and fade into the flames.  Your spirit rises.  There are other things to do besides being a city administrator.  There are many places in the Realmz you have yet to see.

ÝYou brush up against the coffin and accidentally press a secret panel.  The coffin slides open to reveal a skeletal figure inside.  The former king now rests inside the chamber with a powerful weapon grasped in his hands.                                  You could take the weapon if you like or you could close the coffin and pretend that your desecration never took place.  Do you take the weapon?                                                                                                               ñAs you attempt to hide the weapon amid your belongings, a temple guard spots you from the doorway.  "Thieves!  There are thieves in the temple!"  Within seconds, the doorway is jammed with temple guards.  Curses of death fly from their lips.              ‹You try and catch your breath.  More warriors flow down the hall.  It appears that the entire garrison is closing in on you in mad pursuit.                                                                                                                    ×As bees swarm to protect their queen, the warriors attack without mercy.  Stealing the sword is a sacrilege without equal.  Spurred on by the death of their fallen comrades, they renew their attack with a vengeance.                                        ÄA pool of blood writhes around your ankles.  At last, you may rest.  The back of the stalwart defenders of the temple has been broken.  You pray that word of your actions will not reach the queen.                                                           ·Your luck is poor this day.  Knowledge of your desecration of the king's tomb  reaches the queen.  A posse is formed to track you down.  The punishment for your crime will be death.                                                                          ùThoth Amon and his underlings are ordered to lead the search.  Unfortunately, they find you easily.  The queen looks on with approval as Thoth proclaims, "By order of the queen, your lives shall now be forfeited for the atrocities you've committed."      ”Let it be known that the queen has commanded death to those who have committed these crimes.  By my own hand, this punishment shall be carried out."                                                                                                           wWith the first units of the posse slain, Thoth Amon removes his cape.  "It saddens me to draw blood myself.  So be it."                                                                                                                                        ±Upon Thoth Amon's death, the queen commands the townsfolk to rise up and crush you.  Hundreds of peasants, merchants, and traders press in on you.  You flee for your very lives.                                                                              ªYou run from the pursuing mob and manage to hide in a dense, dark forest just northeast of town.

ÔPerhaps, if you carried out your original mission and saved the Realmz, the queen would be willing to pardon your sins.  The only way to know is to try and right your wrongs by saving the Realmz from destruction.                                           nA large mob forces you to flee.  Unable to  redeem yourselves, remaining in the city would mean certain death.                                                                                                                                                 ‡In the distance you see a green tinted sparkle.
