He walks over to the nearby fireplace and reaches up into its throat.  He pulls out....              á...a soot covered scabbard.

His real name...                    ë...is King Dranak!"  He reads from the letter.  "Griloch, my people grow more passive daily as our plan comes to fruition.  Soon no one will suspect me.  As soon as I remove the Jurol problem we can make our move.  I have my best men..                    þ...searching for him and he will be in our grasp shortly.  I await your response.   Yours Eternally,                                             King Dranak, Turnstil Commander."  The guard continues, "I can only imagine what would have befallen us if..  ú...it weren't for you, Jurol Knarl.  Only you and your new friends were able to bring down this evil man from power.  I find it only fitting that a man as great as you should find his place where it belongs, as new King of Turnstil!"  A huge cheer...     ÿ...erupts in the chamber.  "All hail King Knarl.  All hail the house of Knarl.  Three cheers for King Knarl.  Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!"  The crown is ripped from the head of Dranak and placed upon King Knarl's head.  The...   õ...new King speaks to his people.  "Good citizens of Turnstil.  A great wrong has been righted today.  I have only my new friends to thank."  He looks at you and nods in appreciation.  The crowd warmly applauds you.  King Knarl continues, "But..          ø...we have a greater evil to destroy.  Griloch and his evil forces still haunt us.  He is the ultimate evil behind all the wrongs that befall us.  I charge all of you as citizens of Turnstil to do your part in ridding the land of Griloch and all...       ú...his evil forces."  The crowd cheers again.  "Take up arms and fight!  Fight Griloch's evil wherever you encounter it!  I will personally oversee the assemblage of the Turstil army, charged with the utter destruction of Griloch himself.  Join us!"      øAnother huge cheer erupts as citizens, guards and farmers rush to the King's guards to sign on to this new army.  In the confusion the new King makes his way to you.  "You believed in me.  For that I am eternally grateful.  There are far too few..        ò...as brave and wise as you are.  Again my thanks.  I guess this is where we say goodbye.  I have an army to build and you are much too valuable to be tied into any civil army.  Go now and continue your quest.  A quest we share together as...             Ü...brothers."  You say your farewells as King Knarl wades into a mass of Turnstil army volunteers.  He turns once more nodding and smiling to you with confidence before he disappears into the masses of his new citizens.                                    ¹Congratulations!

He sees you out.    °A large patrol of Griloch fighters and champions are marching west.  They are carrying a large chest.  They drop the chest and get into attack formation, drawing their weapons.                                                                               íYou defeat the group of Griloch.  The chest contains one thing.  A letter.  It reads, "King Allstin, all is prepared.  The time to strike is now.  Prepare your loyal followers and be ready for the sign.  I await your response. -Griloch."                  ‰This incriminating letter proves King Allstins is in league with Griloch.

Jurol Knarl is also dead.  Two armed men return to the grand chamber with the King.  They have a letter in their hands.  One of the guards speaks, "This man is NOT King Allstin.  His name..    ò...it weren't for Jurol Knarl.  Only he and his new friends were able to bring down this evil man from power.  It saddens me Jurol has died.  He was a great man with tremendous courage who would have made a good King."  A huge cheer erupts...             ò...in the chamber honoring the dead hero.  "Jurol will be honored in death as if he were King.  People, there is much work to be done.  Griloch and his evil forces still haunt us.  He is the ultimate evil behind all that is wrong amidst us.               ÷I charge all of you as citizens of Turnstil to do your part in ridding the land of Griloch and all his evil forces."
