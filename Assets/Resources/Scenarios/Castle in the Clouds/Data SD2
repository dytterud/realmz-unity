On the man's lap is a piece of parchment.  It is addressed to:  "Whomever finds this note, I am Zukar the Great.                       Ð"I must not seem so great if you are reading this note, since I must have passed on to other realmz.  Alas, even I can not stop the hands of time.  I fear that the land will befall great evil with my absence.                                               ü"It is imperative that whoever finds this note seek out the White Dragon.  She is very wise and will know what to do."  The letter is signed Zukar the Great.  You are left with the feeling of loss.  Your long journey was not supposed to end like this.    ÿThen you realize that during your search for Zukar you have battled the evil that Zukar feared and destroyed it.  You know in your heart that the evil will grow again if it is left unchecked.  You decide you must search for the White Dragon.              ÔThank You for playing Castle in the Clouds.
