Do you?                                                                              ¸Upon entering the house you seem to feel as though it is much bigger on the inside than on the outside.

A simple illusion.  I wouldn't have been able to stay secluded for so long to do my research if these simple , kind folk knew what I was up to.  Yes, there is a second, third, and fourth floor to my tower."  You .. ˙...surmise correctly he is of the magical persuasion.  "You are correct, I am trained in the arts of illusion and magic.  But enough about me.  I have brought you here for a reason.  The map you have in your memory was put there by me.  You see, I...     ˇ...am in need of your help.  A great evil is building a foothold in these parts and I have been charged by the mage masters to see to its snuffing out.  I cannot enlist the services of too powerful a party as it would draw undue attention to itself.  So..˙...I summoned you to my aid.  You are a healthy lot of adventurers hungry for the thrill of money and power.  But, are you hungry for the thrill of justice and honor?  I hope so.  There are some things worth making right in this land of which this...     ˜...is one.  Let me explain.  Throughout the years peace was supreme here.  All of the small villages you see now were together in one bright city called Flavin.  Flavin thrived for over 300 years.  Now, some eight years ago, flavin has split as...        ˚...clouds of sand from who-knows-where descended upon the city, driving away its inhabitants and splintering Flavin into the small towns and villages dotting the land today.  The sand still remains now where  green lush land once stood.  There seems..    Ú...to be a strange coincedence between the sand storms and the disappearance of two brothers, twins, Ollahn and Malear.  Of human descent, they vanished ten years ago and have never been heard of since.  I believe this to be of interest as...             Î...both of them were together when they vanished and the storms arrived in the exact location of their disappearance.  Now, we must find these twins and discover what connection they have to this scurge.  If we can discover the fate...                    Î...which befell them we may have a chance to get to the root of this problem and restore the land to its original condition.  This is your mission.  Why should you accept this charge?  Simple.  Only I have the power to return you to...                    Ù...your homes far, far away from this place.  I will remain here as a source of information for you should you have any questions.  That is all I can tell you now.  If I uncover any information I will summon you.  Good luck."  With that, Emi...

Ë"Excellent.  We can now move on the Queen."  Malear speaks, "Prince Kaley, I know my brother is being mistreated by the Queen.  I have felt this.  How are we going to save him?"  Prince Kaley responds, "Malear, you are brave and....                       ˆ...wise, beyond your years.  But hear me.  We have been digging a secret entrance into the Queens land unknown to her and her protectors.  It is now complete.  We will bring my men and along with you and your brothers powers, will surprise the...         Ò...evil Queen.  With her death and the reuniting of you and your brother, peace will again be restored to this land."  Malear protests, "Sounds too risky for my brother's safety.  How can you guarantee he won't be harmed?"  "Malear, your....              Û...concerns are well founded, for there are no guarantees.  We all may be killed.  The Queen is very powerful.  I cannot guarantee your safety, let alone that of my men or your brother.  But this is our only chance.  She will soon learn you...            ˝...are here.  We must do this now while she is still unaware of what is going on, or we will be sbuffed out by her forces.  I hope you can trust in us, Malear.  We need you to be with us as the power you have in conjunction with your twin is the only...  Ú...force strong enough to defeat her.  You know of what I speak.  You must rejoin your brother!"  "I will," says Malear, "and together my brother and I will defeat the evil queen and bring peace to the land."  A cheer goes up amongst the men.             ˙The Prince waves his hand and all is silent again, "Now.  Here is the map of the secret entrance to the Queens land.  There will be resistance once you get there, but you must get into the castle and kill the Queen after rescuing Ollahn."  Another...     ˘...cheer goes up.  The Prince turns to you, "My men, at great peril, have been hiding out in the Queen's land.  They will greet you when you emerge from the secret tunnel.  Go now!  You have work to do!  I await your return."  You are lofted onto...      ‰...the shoulders of many men, and escorted to the exit.  Amongst many cheers of 'good luck,' 'Go get her,' and 'Hip -  Hip - Hooray,'  you set off with your map with two goals in mind.  Reunite the Twins, and Kill Queen Allimac.                           ≥A guard peers through the gate.  "You have not reunited the twins.  Come back when you have.  Time grows short.  Rumor has it the Queen knows of our plan."  He shuts the eye slit.                                                                            IA guard opens the door.  "You have done it!

They chant, "Long live the twins!  Long live the twins!  Long live the twins!  Allimac is dead!  Allimac is dead!"

Amongst shouts and leaps of joy, the prince calms the crowd, "People, give me your ear!"  The crowd quiets.  A somber look crosses the Prince's face, "Yes.  It is a time for rejoicing.  Let us not forget in our joy those innocent...  Ò...men, women, and children who have died at the hand of the evil Queen Allimac.  Priest Lycon, please sound the chimes and let us have a moment of silence."  The priest sounds the chimes as all remove their helms and bow their heads in a...              ...moment of silence.

They have given up their lives, their families, for our people.  But as we remember these good...                 Û...people, it is a time for rejoicing and for giving thanks!  We have a group of brave adventurers to thank for bringing us peace to the land.  Step forward!"  The prince waves you to him.  "This group risked their lives many times!  Saving...            ˜...Malear, rescuing Ollahn from the Dragons.  Destroying countless orcs and undead minions of evil on this journey.  Making new friends and allies on the way.

There will be food, drink, tournaments, fun for the entire land!           ˘Get your neighbors, get your friends, bring people from all parts!  This is a time to rejoin our land as it was seperated some 10 years ago!  This celebration will never end!"  The crowd disperses, and as the last person leaves you are left alone...      ˚...with the Prince and his guards.  The Prince speaks to you, "You have saved our land.  You have conquered Queen Allimac and reunited the twins.  For this you will have our eternal thanks and gratitude.  I know you will not stay for it is not your...    N...way.

The penalty for the crime is 10 years in the jail.  The owner...              ...is the only witness and Ponburk claims he was set up by the owner and never stole anything.  He has no Alibi, and the owner of the magic shop is well respected in the community.  It looks very bad for Ponburk.  As one of the attorneys...

The guards are armed to the...                 Ô...teeth, but everyone else has on nothing but the brown robes.  Overseeing the proceeding is the town Constable, Judge Diryte.
